// ___________________________________________ 1 Comment Your JavaScript Code

/*
Comments are lines of code that JavaScript will intentionally ignore.
Comments are a great way to leave notes to yourself and to other people
 who will later need to figure out what that code does.

There are two ways to write comments in JavaScript:

Using // will tell JavaScript to ignore the remainder of the text on the current line. This is an in-line comment:

// This is an in-line comment.
You can make a multi-line comment beginning with and ending with .

NOTE: As you write code, you should regularly add comments to clarify the function of parts of your code.
Good commenting can help communicate the intent of your code—both for others and for your future self.

Try creating one of each type of comment.

// ___________________________________________ 2 Declare JavaScript Variables

/*
In computer science, data is anything that is meaningful to the computer. JavaScript provides eight different data types which are undefined, null, boolean, string, symbol, bigint, number, and object.

For example, computers distinguish between numbers, such as the number 12, and strings, such as "12", "dog", or "123 cats", which are collections of characters. Computers can perform mathematical operations on a number, but not on a string.

Variables allow computers to store and manipulate data in a dynamic fashion. They do this by using a "label" to point to the data rather than using the data itself. Any of the eight data types may be stored in a variable.

Variables are similar to the x and y variables you use in mathematics, which means they're a simple name to represent the data we want to refer to. Computer variables differ from mathematical variables in that they can store different values at different times.

We tell JavaScript to create or declare a variable by putting the keyword var in front of it, like so:

var ourName;
creates a variable called ourName. In JavaScript we end statements with semicolons. Variable names can be made up of numbers, letters, and $ or _, but may not contain spaces or start with a number.

Use the var keyword to create a variable called myNaффme.

Hint
Look at the ourName example above if you get stuck.
 */
var myName;
// ___________________________________________ 3 Storing Values with the Assignment Operator

/*
In JavaScript, you can store a value in a variable with the assignment operator (=).

myVariable = 5;
This assigns the Number value 5 to myVariable.

If there are any calculations to the right of the = operator, those are performed before the value is assigned to the variable on the left of the operator.

var myVar;
myVar = 5;
First, this code creates a variable named myVar. Then, the code assigns 5 to myVar. Now, if myVar appears again in the code, the program will treat it as if it is 5.

Assign the value 7 to variable a.
 */
var a;
a = 7
// ___________________________________________ 4 Assigning the Value of One Variable to Another

/*
After a value is assigned to a variable using the assignment operator, you can assign the value of that variable to another variable using the assignment operator.

var myVar;
myVar = 5;
var myNum;
myNum = myVar;
The above declares a myVar variable with no value, then assigns it the value 5. Next, a variable named myNum is declared with no value. Then, the contents of myVar (which is 5) is assigned to the variable myNum. Now, myNum also has the value of 5.

Assign the contents of a to variable b.
 */
var a;
a = 7;
var b;
b = a;
// ___________________________________________ 5 Initializing Variables with the Assignment Operator

/*
It is common to initialize a variable to an initial value in the same line as it is declared.

var myVar = 0;
Creates a new variable called myVar and assigns it an initial value of 0.

Define a variable a with var and initialize it to a value of 9.
 */
var a = 9;
// ___________________________________________ 6 Declare String Variables

/*
Previously you used the following code to declare a variable:

var myName;
But you can also declare a string variable like this:

var myName = "your name";
"your name" is called a string literal. A string literal, or string,
is a series of zero or more characters enclosed in single or double quotes.

Create two new string variables: myFirstName and myLastName
and assign them the values of your first and last name, respectively.
 */
const myFirstName = 'ilia';
const myLastName = 'kravtsov';
// ___________________________________________ 7 Understanding Uninitialized Variables

/*
When JavaScript variables are declared, they have an initial value of undefined.
If you do a mathematical operation on an undefined variable your result will be NaN which means "Not a Number".
If you concatenate a string with an undefined variable, you will get a string of undefined.

Initialize the three variables a, b, and c with 5, 10, and "I am a" respectively so that they will not be undefined.
 */
var a = 5;
var b = 10;
var c = 'I am a';
// ___________________________________________ 8 Understanding Case Sensitivity in Variables

/*
 In JavaScript all variables and function names are case sensitive. This means that capitalization matters.

 MYVAR is not the same as MyVar nor myvar. It is possible to have multiple distinct variables with the same name but different casing. It is strongly recommended that for the sake of clarity, you do not use this language feature.

 Best Practice

 Write variable names in JavaScript in camelCase. In camelCase, multi-word variable names have the first word in lowercase and the first letter of each subsequent word is capitalized.

 Examples:

 var someVariable;
 var anotherVariableName;
 var thisVariableNameIsSoLong;
 Modify the existing declarations and assignments so their names use camelCase.

 Do not create any new variables.
 */
// Variable declarations
var studlyCapVar;
var properCamelCase;
var titleCaseOver;

// Variable assignments
studlyCapVar = 10;
properCamelCase = "A String";
titleCaseOver = 9000;
// ___________________________________________ 9 Explore Differences Between the var and let Keywords

/*
One of the biggest problems with declaring variables with the var keyword is that you can easily overwrite variable declarations:

var camper = "James";
var camper = "David";
console.log(camper);
In the code above, the camper variable is originally declared as James, and is then overridden to be David. The console then displays the string David.

In a small application, you might not run into this type of problem. But as your codebase becomes larger, you might accidentally overwrite a variable that you did not intend to. Because this behavior does not throw an error, searching for and fixing bugs becomes more difficult.

A keyword called let was introduced in ES6, a major update to JavaScript, to solve this potential issue with the var keyword. You'll learn about other ES6 features in later challenges.

If you replace var with let in the code above, it results in an error:

let camper = "James";
let camper = "David";
The error can be seen in your browser console.

So unlike var, when you use let, a variable with the same name can only be declared once.

Update the code so it only uses the let keyword.
 */
let catName = "Oliver";
let catSound = "Meow!";
// ___________________________________________ 10 Declare a Read-Only Variable with the const Keyword

/*
The keyword let is not the only new way to declare variables. In ES6, you can also declare variables using the const keyword.

const has all the awesome features that let has, with the added bonus that variables declared using const are read-only. They are a constant value, which means that once a variable is assigned with const, it cannot be reassigned:

const FAV_PET = "Cats";
FAV_PET = "Dogs";
The console will display an error due to reassigning the value of FAV_PET.

You should always name variables you don't want to reassign using the const keyword. This helps when you accidentally attempt to reassign a variable that is meant to stay constant.

Note: It is common for developers to use uppercase variable identifiers for immutable values and lowercase or camelCase for mutable values (objects and arrays). You will learn more about objects, arrays, and immutable and mutable values in later challenges. Also in later challenges, you will see examples of uppercase, lowercase, or camelCase variable identifiers.

Change the code so that all variables are declared using let or const. Use let when you want the variable to change, and const when you want the variable to remain constant. Also, rename variables declared with const to conform to common practices. Do not change the strings assigned to the variables.

// ___________________________________________ 11 Add Two Numbers with JavaScript

/*
Number is a data type in JavaScript which represents numeric data.

Now let's try to add two numbers using JavaScript.

JavaScript uses the + symbol as an addition operator when placed between two numbers.

Example:

const myVar = 5 + 10;
myVar now has the value 15.

Change the 0 so that sum will equal 20.
 */
const sum = 10 + 10;
// ___________________________________________ 12 Subtract One Number from Another with JavaScript

/*
We can also subtract one number from another.

JavaScript uses the - symbol for subtraction.

Example

const myVar = 12 - 6;
myVar would have the value 6.

Change the 0 so the difference is 12.
 */
const difference = 45 - 33;
// ___________________________________________ 13 Multiply Two Numbers with JavaScript

/*
We can also multiply one number by another.

JavaScript uses the * symbol for multiplication of two numbers.

Example

const myVar = 13 * 13;
myVar would have the value 169.

Change the 0 so that product will equal 80.
 */
const product = 8 * 10;
// ___________________________________________ 14 Divide One Number by Another with JavaScript

/*
We can also divide one number by another.

JavaScript uses the / symbol for division.

Example

const myVar = 16 / 2;
myVar now has the value 8.

Change the 0 so that the quotient is equal to 2.
 */
const quotient = 66 / 33;
// ___________________________________________ 15 Increment a Number with JavaScript

/*
You can easily increment or add one to a variable with the ++ operator.

i++;
is the equivalent of

i = i + 1;
Note: The entire line becomes i++;, eliminating the need for the equal sign.

Change the code to use the ++ operator on myVar.
 */
let myVar = 87;

// Only change code below this line
myVar++;
// ___________________________________________ 16 Decrement a Number with JavaScript

/*
You can easily decrement or decrease a variable by one with the -- operator.

i--;
is the equivalent of

i = i - 1;
Note: The entire line becomes i--;, eliminating the need for the equal sign.

Change the code to use the -- operator on myVar.
 */
let myVar = 11;

// Only change code below this line
myVar--;
// ___________________________________________ 17 Create Decimal Numbers with JavaScript

/*
We can store decimal numbers in variables too. Decimal numbers are sometimes referred to as floating point numbers or floats.

Note: when you compute numbers, they are computed with finite precision. Operations using floating points may lead to different results than the desired outcome. If you are getting one of these results, open a topic on the freeCodeCamp forum.

Create a variable myDecimal and give it a decimal value with a fractional part (e.g. 5.7).
 */
const ourDecimal = 5.7;

// Only change code below this line
const myDecimal = 1.2
// ___________________________________________ 18 Multiply Two Decimals with JavaScript

/*
In JavaScript, you can also perform calculations with decimal numbers, just like whole numbers.

Let's multiply two decimals together to get their product.

Change the 0.0 so that product will equal 5.0.
 */
const product = 2.0 * 2.5;
// ___________________________________________ 19 Divide One Decimal by Another with JavaScript

/*
Now let's divide one decimal by another.

Change the 0.0 so that quotient will equal to 2.2.
 */
const quotient = 4.4 / 2.0; // Change this line
// ___________________________________________ 20 Finding a Remainder in JavaScript

/*
The remainder operator % gives the remainder of the division of two numbers.

Example

5 % 2 = 1
5 / 2 = 2 remainder 1
2 * 2 = 4
5 - 4 = 1
Usage
In mathematics, a number can be checked to be even or odd by checking the remainder of the division of the number by 2. Even numbers have a remainder of 0, while odd numbers a remainder of 1.

17 % 2 = 1
48 % 2 = 0
Note: The remainder operator is sometimes incorrectly referred to as the modulus operator. It is very similar to modulus, but does not work properly with negative numbers.

Set remainder equal to the remainder of 11 divided by 3 using the remainder (%) operator.
 */
const remainder = 11 % 3;
// ___________________________________________ 21 Compound Assignment With Augmented Addition

/*
In programming, it is common to use assignments to modify the contents of a variable. Remember that everything to the right of the equals sign is evaluated first, so we can say:

myVar = myVar + 5;
to add 5 to myVar. Since this is such a common pattern, there are operators which do both a mathematical operation and assignment in one step.

One such operator is the += operator.

let myVar = 1;
myVar += 5;
console.log(myVar);
6 would be displayed in the console.

Convert the assignments for a, b, and c to use the += operator.
 */
let a = 3;
let b = 17;
let c = 12;

// Only change code below this line
a += 12;
b += 9;
c += 7;
// ___________________________________________ 22 Compound Assignment With Augmented Subtraction

/*
Like the += operator, -= subtracts a number from a variable.

myVar = myVar - 5;
will subtract 5 from myVar. This can be rewritten as:

myVar -= 5;
Convert the assignments for a, b, and c to use the -= operator.
 */
let a = 11;
let b = 9;
let c = 3;

// Only change code below this line
a -= 6;
b -= 15;
c -= 1;
// ___________________________________________ 23 Compound Assignment With Augmented Multiplication

/*
The *= operator multiplies a variable by a number.

myVar = myVar * 5;
will multiply myVar by 5. This can be rewritten as:

myVar *= 5;
Convert the assignments for a, b, and c to use the *= operator.
 */
let a = 5;
let b = 12;
let c = 4.6;

// Only change code below this line
a *= 5;
b *= 3;
c *= 10;
// ___________________________________________ 24 Compound Assignment With Augmented Division

/*
The /= operator divides a variable by another number.

myVar = myVar / 5;
Will divide myVar by 5. This can be rewritten as:

myVar /= 5;
Convert the assignments for a, b, and c to use the /= operator.
 */
let a = 48;
let b = 108;
let c = 33;

// Only change code below this line
a /= 12;
b /= 4;
c /= 11;
// ___________________________________________ 25 Escaping Literal Quotes in Strings

/*
When you are defining a string you must start and end with a single or double quote. What happens when you need a literal quote: " or ' inside of your string?

In JavaScript, you can escape a quote from considering it as an end of string quote by placing a backslash (\) in front of the quote.

const sampleStr = "Alan said, \"Peter is learning JavaScript\".";
This signals to JavaScript that the following quote is not the end of the string, but should instead appear inside the string. So if you were to print this to the console, you would get:

Alan said, "Peter is learning JavaScript".
Use backslashes to assign a string to the myStr variable so that if you were to print it to the console, you would see:

I am a "double quoted" string inside "double quotes".
 */
const myStr = "I am a \"double quoted\" string inside \"double quotes\"."; // Change this line

// ___________________________________________ 26 Quoting Strings with Single Quotes


/*
String values in JavaScript may be written with single or double quotes, as long as you start and end with the same type of quote. Unlike some other programming languages, single and double quotes work the same in JavaScript.

const doubleQuoteStr = "This is a string"; 
const singleQuoteStr = 'This is also a string';
The reason why you might want to use one type of quote over the other is if you want to use both in a string. This might happen if you want to save a conversation in a string and have the conversation in quotes. Another use for it would be saving an <a> tag with various attributes in quotes, all within a string.

const conversation = 'Finn exclaims to Jake, "Algebraic!"';
However, this becomes a problem if you need to use the outermost quotes within it. Remember, a string has the same kind of quote at the beginning and end. But if you have that same quote somewhere in the middle, the string will stop early and throw an error.

const goodStr = 'Jake asks Finn, "Hey, let\'s go on an adventure?"'; 
const badStr = 'Finn responds, "Let's go!"';
Here badStr will throw an error.

In the goodStr above, you can use both quotes safely by using the backslash \ as an escape character.

Note: The backslash \ should not be confused with the forward slash /. They do not do the same thing.

Change the provided string to a string with single quotes at the beginning and end and no escape characters.

Right now, the <a> tag in the string uses double quotes everywhere. You will need to change the outer quotes to single quotes so you can remove the escape characters.
 */
const myStr = '<a href="http://www.example.com" target="_blank">Link</a>';

// ___________________________________________ 27 Escape Sequences in Strings

/*
Quotes are not the only characters that can be escaped inside a string. Escape sequences allow you to use characters you may not otherwise be able to use in a string.

Code	Output
\'	single quote
\"	double quote
\\	backslash
\n	newline
\t	tab
\r	carriage return
\b	backspace
\f	form feed
Note that the backslash itself must be escaped in order to display as a backslash.

Assign the following three lines of text into the single variable myStr using escape sequences.

FirstLine
    \SecondLine
ThirdLine
You will need to use escape sequences to insert special characters correctly. You will also need to follow the spacing as it looks above, with no spaces between escape sequences or words.

Note: The indentation for SecondLine is achieved with the tab escape character, not spaces.
 */
const myStr = "FirstLine\n\t\\SecondLine\nThirdLine"; // Change this line

// ___________________________________________ 28 Concatenating Strings with Plus Operator

/*
In JavaScript, when the + operator is used with a String value, it is called the concatenation operator. You can build a new string out of other strings by concatenating them together.

Example

'My name is Alan,' + ' I concatenate.'
Note: Watch out for spaces. Concatenation does not add spaces between concatenated strings, so you'll need to add them yourself.

Example:

const ourStr = "I come first. " + "I come second.";
The string I come first. I come second. would be displayed in the console.

Build myStr from the strings This is the start. and This is the end. using the + operator. Be sure to include a space between the two strings.
 */

const myStr = 'This is the start. ' + 'This is the end.'; // Change this line

// ___________________________________________ 29 Concatenating Strings with the Plus Equals Operator

/*
We can also use the += operator to concatenate a string onto the end of an existing string variable. This can be very helpful to break a long string over several lines.

Note: Watch out for spaces. Concatenation does not add spaces between concatenated strings, so you'll need to add them yourself.

Example:

let ourStr = "I come first. ";
ourStr += "I come second.";
ourStr now has a value of the string I come first. I come second..

Build myStr over several lines by concatenating these two strings: This is the first sentence. and This is the second sentence. using the += operator. Use the += operator similar to how it is shown in the example and be sure to include a space between the two strings. Start by assigning the first string to myStr, then add on the second string.
 */
let myStr = 'This is the first sentence. ';
myStr += 'This is the second sentence.'

// ___________________________________________ 30 Constructing Strings with Variables

/*
Sometimes you will need to build a string. By using the concatenation operator (+), you can insert one or more variables into a string you're building.

Example:

const ourName = "freeCodeCamp";
const ourStr = "Hello, our name is " + ourName + ", how are you?";
ourStr would have a value of the string Hello, our name is freeCodeCamp, how are you?.

Set myName to a string equal to your name and build myStr with myName between the strings My name is  and  and I am well!
 */
// Only change code below this line
const myName = "ilia";
const myStr = 'My name is ' + myName + ' and I am well!';

// ___________________________________________ 31 Appending Variables to Strings

/*
Just as we can build a string over multiple lines out of string literals, we can also append variables to a string using the plus equals (+=) operator.

Example:

const anAdjective = "awesome!";
let ourStr = "freeCodeCamp is ";
ourStr += anAdjective;
ourStr would have the value freeCodeCamp is awesome!.

Set someAdjective to a string of at least 3 characters and append it to myStr using the += operator.

 */
const someAdjective = "wonderful";
let myStr = "Learning to code is ";
myStr += someAdjective

// ___________________________________________ 32 Find the Length of a String

/*
You can find the length of a String value by writing .length after the string variable or string literal.

console.log("Alan Peter".length);
The value 10 would be displayed in the console. Note that the space character between "Alan" and "Peter" is also counted.

For example, if we created a variable const firstName = "Ada", we could find out how long the string Ada is by using the firstName.length property.

Use the .length property to set lastNameLength to the number of characters in lastName.

по моему мы сможем использовать length для обрезания строки

// Setup
let lastNameLength = 0;
const lastName = "Lovelace";

lastNameLength = lastName.length;
// ___________________________________________ 33 Use Bracket Notation to Find the First Character in a String

/*
Bracket notation is a way to get a character at a specific index within a string.

Most modern programming languages, like JavaScript, don't start counting at 1 like humans do. They start at 0. This is referred to as Zero-based indexing.

For example, the character at index 0 in the word Charles is C. So if const firstName = "Charles", you can get the value of the first letter of the string by using firstName[0].

Example:

const firstName = "Charles";
const firstLetter = firstName[0];
firstLetter would have a value of the string C.

Use bracket notation to find the first character in the lastName variable and assign it to firstLetterOfLastName.

Hint: Try looking at the example above if you get stuck.

let firstLetterOfLastName = "";
const lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line
firstLetterOfLastName = lastName[0]; // Change this line
// ___________________________________________ 34 Understand String Immutability

/*
In JavaScript, String values are immutable, which means that they cannot be altered once created.

For example, the following code will produce an error because the letter B in the string Bob cannot be changed to the letter J:

let myStr = "Bob";
myStr[0] = "J";
Note that this does not mean that myStr could not be re-assigned. The only way to change myStr would be to assign it with a new value, like this:

let myStr = "Bob";
myStr = "Job";
Correct the assignment to myStr so it contains the string value of Hello World using the approach shown in the example above.
 */
// Setup
let myStr = "Jello World";

// Only change code below this line
myStr = "Hello World"; // Change this line

// ___________________________________________ 36 Use Bracket Notation to Find the Last Character in a String

/*
In order to get the last letter of a string, you can subtract one from the string's length.

For example, if const firstName = "Ada", you can get the value of the last letter of the string by using firstName[firstName.length - 1].

Example:

const firstName = "Ada";
const lastLetter = firstName[firstName.length - 1];
lastLetter would have a value of the string a.

// ___________________________________________ 37 Use Bracket Notation to Find the Nth-to-Last Character in a String

/*
You can use the same principle we just used to retrieve the last character in a string to retrieve the Nth-to-last character.

For example, you can get the value of the third-to-last letter of the const firstName = "Augusta" string by using firstName[firstName.length - 3]

Example:

const firstName = "Augusta";
const thirdToLastLetter = firstName[firstName.length - 3];
thirdToLastLetter would have a value of the string s.

Use bracket notation to find the second-to-last character in the lastName string.

/*
You are provided sentences with some missing words, like nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs. You then fill in the missing pieces with words of your choice in a way that the completed sentence makes sense.

Consider this sentence:

It was really ____, and we ____ ourselves ____.

const sentence = "It was really " + "hot" + ", and we " + "laughed" + " ourselves " + "silly" + ".";
In this challenge, we provide you with a noun, a verb, an adjective and an adverb. You need to form a complete sentence using words of your choice, along with the words we provide.

You will need to use the string concatenation operator + to build a new string, using the provided variables: myNoun, myAdjective, myVerb, and myAdverb. You will then assign the formed string to the wordBlanks variable. You should not change the words assigned to the variables.

You will also need to account for spaces in your string, so that the final sentence has spaces between all the words. The result should be a complete sentence.

/*
With JavaScript array variables, we can store several pieces of data in one place.

You start an array declaration with an opening square bracket, end it with a closing square bracket, and put a comma between each entry, like this:

const sandwich = ["peanut butter", "jelly", "bread"];
Modify the new array myArray so that it contains both a string and a number (in that order).

This is also called a multi-dimensional array.

Create a nested array called myArray.
 */
// Only change code below this line
const myArray = [['some'], [123]];
// ___________________________________________ 41 Access Array Data with Indexes

/*
We can access the data inside arrays using indexes.

Array indexes are written in the same bracket notation that strings use, except that instead of specifying a character, they are specifying an entry in the array. Like strings, arrays use zero-based indexing, so the first element in an array has an index of 0.


Example

const array = [50, 60, 70];
console.log(array[0]);
const data = array[1];
The console.log(array[0]) prints 50, and data has the value 60.

Unlike strings, the entries of arrays are mutable and can be changed freely, even if the array was declared with const.

Example

const ourArray = [50, 40, 30];
ourArray[0] = 15;
ourArray now has the value [15, 40, 30].

Note: There shouldn't be any spaces between the array name and the square brackets, like array [0]. Although JavaScript is able to process this correctly, this may confuse other programmers reading your code.

myArray[0] = 45
// ___________________________________________ 43 Access Multi-Dimensional Arrays With Indexes

/*
One way to think of a multi-dimensional array, is as an array of arrays. When you use brackets to access your array, the first set of brackets refers to the entries in the outermost (the first level) array, and each additional pair of brackets refers to the next level of entries inside.

Example

const arr = [
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6],
  [7, 8, 9],
  [[10, 11, 12], 13, 14]
];

const subarray = arr[3];
const nestedSubarray = arr[3][0];
const element = arr[3][0][1];
In this example, subarray has the value [[10, 11, 12], 13, 14], nestedSubarray has the value [10, 11, 12], and element has the value 11 .

Note: There shouldn't be any spaces between the array name and the square brackets, like array [0][0] and even this array [0] [0] is not allowed. Although JavaScript is able to process this correctly, this may confuse other programmers reading your code.

Using bracket notation select an element from myArray such that myData is equal to 8.

const myArray = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],

// ___________________________________________ 44 Manipulate Arrays With push Method

/*
An easy way to append data to the end of an array is via the push() method.

The push() method takes one or more arguments and appends them to the end of the array, in the order in which they appear. It returns the new length of the array.

Examples:

const arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
arr1.push(4, 5);

const arr2 = ["Stimpson", "J", "cat"];
arr2.push(["happy", "joy"]);
arr1 now has the value [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and arr2 has the value ["Stimpson", "J", "cat", ["happy", "joy"]].

Push ["dog", 3] onto the end of the myArray variable.
 */
// Setup
const myArray = [["John", 23], ["cat", 2]];

// Only change code below this line
myArray.push(["dog", 3])
// ___________________________________________ 45 Manipulate Arrays With pop Method

/*
Another way to change the data in an array is with the .pop() function.

.pop() is used to pop a value off of the end of an array. We can store this popped off value by assigning it to a variable. In other words, .pop() removes the last element from an array and returns that element.

Any type of entry can be popped off of an array - numbers, strings, even nested arrays.

const threeArr = [1, 4, 6];
const oneDown = threeArr.pop();
console.log(oneDown);
console.log(threeArr);
The first console.log will display the value 6, and the second will display the value [1, 4].

Use the .pop() function to remove the last item from myArray and assign the popped off value to a new variable, removedFromMyArray.
 */
// Setup
const myArray = [["John", 23], ["cat", 2]];

// Only change code below this line
const removedFromMyArray = myArray.pop()
// ___________________________________________ 46 Manipulate Arrays With shift Method

/*
pop() always removes the last element of an array. What if you want to remove the first?

That's where .shift() comes in. It works just like .pop(), except it removes the first element instead of the last.

Example:

const ourArray = ["Stimpson", "J", ["cat"]];
const removedFromOurArray = ourArray.shift();
removedFromOurArray would have a value of the string Stimpson, and ourArray would have ["J", ["cat"]].

Use the .shift() function to remove the first item from myArray and assign the "shifted off" value to a new variable, removedFromMyArray.
 */
// Setup
const myArray = [["John", 23], ["dog", 3]];

// Only change code below this line
const removedFromMyArray = myArray.shift()
// ___________________________________________ 47 Manipulate Arrays With unshift Method

/*
Not only can you shift elements off of the beginning of an array, you can also unshift elements to the beginning of an array i.e. add elements in front of the array.

.unshift() works exactly like .push(), but instead of adding the element at the end of the array, unshift() adds the element at the beginning of the array.

Example:

const ourArray = ["Stimpson", "J", "cat"];
ourArray.shift();
ourArray.unshift("Happy");
After the shift, ourArray would have the value ["J", "cat"]. After the unshift, ourArray would have the value ["Happy", "J", "cat"].

Add ["Paul", 35] to the beginning of the myArray variable using unshift().
 */
// Setup
const myArray = [["John", 23], ["dog", 3]];
myArray.shift();

// Only change code below this line
myArray.unshift(["Paul", 35])
// ___________________________________________ 48 Shopping List

/*
Create a shopping list in the variable myList. The list should be a multi-dimensional array containing several sub-arrays.

The first element in each sub-array should contain a string with the name of the item. The second element should be a number representing the quantity i.e.

["Chocolate Bar", 15]
There should be at least 5 sub-arrays in the list.
 */
const myList = [["Chocolate Bar", 15],["Chocolate Bar", 15],["Chocolate Bar", 15],["Chocolate Bar", 15],["Chocolate Bar", 15],];
// ___________________________________________ 49 Write Reusable JavaScript with Functions

/*
In JavaScript, we can divide up our code into reusable parts called functions.

Here's an example of a function:

function functionName() {
  console.log("Hello World");
}
You can call or invoke this function by using its name followed by parentheses, like this: functionName(); Each time the function is called it will print out the message Hello World on the dev console. All of the code between the curly braces will be executed every time the function is called.

Create a function called reusableFunction which prints the string Hi World to the dev console.
Call the function.

 */
function reusableFunction() {
    console.log('Hi World')
  }
  
  reusableFunction()
// ___________________________________________ 50 Passing Values to Functions with Arguments

/*
Parameters are variables that act as placeholders for the values that are to be input to a function when it is called. When a function is defined, it is typically defined along with one or more parameters. The actual values that are input (or "passed") into a function when it is called are known as arguments.

Here is a function with two parameters, param1 and param2:

function testFun(param1, param2) {
  console.log(param1, param2);
}
Then we can call testFun like this: testFun("Hello", "World");. We have passed two string arguments, Hello and World. Inside the function, param1 will equal the string Hello and param2 will equal the string World. Note that you could call testFun again with different arguments and the parameters would take on the value of the new arguments.

Create a function called functionWithArgs that accepts two arguments and outputs their sum to the dev console.
Call the function with two numbers as arguments.
 */
function functionWithArgs (param1, param2) {
    console.log(param1 + param2)
  }
  
  functionWithArgs(1,2)

// ___________________________________________ 51 Return a Value from a Function with Return

/*
We can pass values into a function with arguments. You can use a return statement to send a value back out of a function.

Example

function plusThree(num) {
  return num + 3;
}

const answer = plusThree(5);
answer has the value 8.

plusThree takes an argument for num and returns a value equal to num + 3.

Create a function timesFive that accepts one argument, multiplies it by 5, and returns the new value.
 */
function timesFive (num) {
  return num * 5
}
// ___________________________________________ 52 Global Scope and Functions

/*
In JavaScript, scope refers to the visibility of variables. Variables which are defined outside of a function block have Global scope. This means, they can be seen everywhere in your JavaScript code.

Variables which are declared without the let or const keywords are automatically created in the global scope. This can create unintended consequences elsewhere in your code or when running a function again. You should always declare your variables with let or const.

Using let or const, declare a global variable named myGlobal outside of any function. Initialize it with a value of 10.

Inside function fun1, assign 5 to oopsGlobal without using the var, let or const keywords.
 */
// Declare the myGlobal variable below this line
const myGlobal = 10;

function fun1() {
  // Assign 5 to oopsGlobal here
  oopsGlobal = 5
}

// Only change code above this line

function fun2() {
  let output = "";
  if (typeof myGlobal != "undefined") {
    output += "myGlobal: " + myGlobal;
  }
  if (typeof oopsGlobal != "undefined") {
    output += " oopsGlobal: " + oopsGlobal;
  }
  console.log(output);
}
// ___________________________________________ 53 Local Scope and Functions


/*
Variables which are declared within a function, as well as the function parameters, have local scope. That means they are only visible within that function.

Here is a function myTest with a local variable called loc.

function myTest() {
  const loc = "foo";
  console.log(loc);
}

myTest();
console.log(loc);
The myTest() function call will display the string foo in the console. The console.log(loc) line (outside of the myTest function) will throw an error, as loc is not defined outside of the function.

The editor has two console.logs to help you see what is happening. Check the console as you code to see how it changes. Declare a local variable myVar inside myLocalScope and run the tests.

Note: The console will still display ReferenceError: myVar is not defined, but this will not cause the tests to fail.
 */
function myLocalScope() {
  // Only change code below this line
  const myVar = 'some'
  console.log('inside myLocalScope', myVar);
}
myLocalScope();

// Run and check the console
// myVar is not defined outside of myLocalScope
console.log('outside myLocalScope', myVar);
// ___________________________________________ 54 Global vs. Local Scope in Functions

/*
It is possible to have both local and global variables with the same name. When you do this, the local variable takes precedence over the global variable.

In this example:

const someVar = "Hat";

function myFun() {
  const someVar = "Head";
  return someVar;
}
The function myFun will return the string Head because the local version of the variable is present.

Add a local variable to myOutfit function to override the value of outerWear with the string sweater.
 */
// Setup
const outerWear = "T-Shirt";

function myOutfit() {
  // Only change code below this line
  const outerWear = 'sweater'
  // Only change code above this line
  return outerWear;

myOutfit();
// ___________________________________________ 55 Understanding Undefined Value returned from a Function


/*
A function can include the return statement but it does not have to. In the case that the function doesn't have a return statement, when you call it, the function processes the inner code but the returned value is undefined.

Example

let sum = 0;

function addSum(num) {
  sum = sum + num;
}

addSum(3);
addSum is a function without a return statement. The function will change the global sum variable but the returned value of the function is undefined.

Create a function addFive without any arguments. This function adds 5 to the sum variable, but its returned value is undefined.
 */
// Setup
let sum = 0;

function addThree() {
  sum = sum + 3;
}

// Only change code below this line

function addFive() {
  sum += 5;
}
// Only change code above this line

addThree();
addFive();
// ___________________________________________ 56 Assignment with a Returned Value

/*
If you'll recall from our discussion about Storing Values with the Assignment Operator, everything to the right of the equal sign is resolved before the value is assigned. This means we can take the return value of a function and assign it to a variable.

Assume we have defined a function sum which adds two numbers together.

ourSum = sum(5, 12);
Calling the sum function with the arguments of 5 and 12 produces a return value of 17. This return value is assigned to the ourSum variable.

Call the processArg function with an argument of 7 and assign its return value to the variable processed.

let processed = 0;

function processArg(num) {
  return (num + 3) / 5;

// ___________________________________________ 57 Stand in Line

/*
In Computer Science a queue is an abstract Data Structure where items are kept in order. New items can be added at the back of the queue and old items are taken off from the front of the queue.

Write a function nextInLine which takes an array (arr) and a number (item) as arguments.

Add the number to the end of the array, then remove the first element of the array.

The nextInLine function should then return the element that was removed.

function nextInLine(arr, item) {
  // Only change code below this line
  arr.push(item)

console.log(nextInLine(testArr, 6));
console.log("After: " + JSON.stringify(testArr));
// ___________________________________________ 58 Understanding Boolean Values

/*
Another data type is the Boolean. Booleans may only be one of two values: true or false. They are basically little on-off switches, where true is on and false is off. These two states are mutually exclusive.

Note: Boolean values are never written with quotes. The strings "true" and "false" are not Boolean and have no special meaning in JavaScript.

Modify the welcomeToBooleans function so that it returns true instead of false.


 */
function welcomeToBooleans() {
  // Only change code below this line

  return true; // Change this line

  // Only change code above this line
}
// ___________________________________________ 59 Use Conditional Logic with If Statements

/*
if statements are used to make decisions in code. The keyword if tells JavaScript to execute the code in the curly braces under certain conditions, defined in the parentheses. These conditions are known as Boolean conditions and they may only be true or false.

When the condition evaluates to true, the program executes the statement inside the curly braces. When the Boolean condition evaluates to false, the statement inside the curly braces will not execute.

Pseudocode

if (condition is true) {
  statement is executed
}
Example

function test (myCondition) {
  if (myCondition) {
    return "It was true";
  }
  return "It was false";
}

test(true);
test(false);
test(true) returns the string It was true, and test(false) returns the string It was false.

When test is called with a value of true, the if statement evaluates myCondition to see if it is true or not. Since it is true, the function returns It was true. When we call test with a value of false, myCondition is not true and the statement in the curly braces is not executed and the function returns It was false.

Create an if statement inside the function to return Yes, that was true if the parameter wasThatTrue is true and return No, that was false otherwise.
 */
function trueOrFalse(wasThatTrue) {
  // Only change code below this line
  if (wasThatTrue) {
    return 'Yes, that was true'
  } else {
    return 'No, that was false'
  }


  // Only change code above this line

}
// ___________________________________________ 60 Comparison with the Equality Operator

/*
There are many comparison operators in JavaScript. All of these operators return a boolean true or false value.

The most basic operator is the equality operator ==. The equality operator compares two values and returns true if they're equivalent or false if they are not. Note that equality is different from assignment (=), which assigns the value on the right of the operator to a variable on the left.

function equalityTest(myVal) {
  if (myVal == 10) {
    return "Equal";
  }
  return "Not Equal";
}
If myVal is equal to 10, the equality operator returns true, so the code in the curly braces will execute, and the function will return Equal. Otherwise, the function will return Not Equal. In order for JavaScript to compare two different data types (for example, numbers and strings), it must convert one type to another. This is known as Type Coercion. Once it does, however, it can compare terms as follows:

1   ==  1  // true
1   ==  2  // false
1   == '1' // true
"3" ==  3  // true
Add the equality operator to the indicated line so that the function will return the string Equal when val is equivalent to 12.
 */
// Setup
function testEqual(val) {
  if (val == 12 ) { // Change this line
    return "Equal";
  }
  return "Not Equal";
}

testEqual(10);
// ___________________________________________ 61 Comparison with the Strict Equality Operator

/*
Strict equality (===) is the counterpart to the equality operator (==). However, unlike the equality operator, which attempts to convert both values being compared to a common type, the strict equality operator does not perform a type conversion.

If the values being compared have different types, they are considered unequal, and the strict equality operator will return false.

Examples

3 ===  3  // true
3 === '3' // false
In the second example, 3 is a Number type and '3' is a String type.

Use the strict equality operator in the if statement so the function will return the string Equal when val is strictly equal to 7.
 */
// Setup
function testStrict(val) {
  if (val === 7) { // Change this line
    return "Equal";
  }
  return "Not Equal";
}

testStrict(10);
// ___________________________________________ 62 Practice comparing different values

/*
In the last two challenges, we learned about the equality operator (==) and the strict equality operator (===). Let's do a quick review and practice using these operators some more.

If the values being compared are not of the same type, the equality operator will perform a type conversion, and then evaluate the values. However, the strict equality operator will compare both the data type and value as-is, without converting one type to the other.

Examples

3 == '3' returns true because JavaScript performs type conversion from string to number. 3 === '3' returns false because the types are different and type conversion is not performed.

Note: In JavaScript, you can determine the type of a variable or a value with the typeof operator, as follows:

typeof 3
typeof '3'
typeof 3 returns the string number, and typeof '3' returns the string string.

The compareEquality function in the editor compares two values using the equality operator. Modify the function so that it returns the string Equal only when the values are strictly equal.
 */
// Setup
function compareEquality(a, b) {
  if (a === b) { // Change this line
    return "Equal";
  }
  return "Not Equal";
}

compareEquality(10, "10");
// ___________________________________________ 63 Comparison with the Inequality Operator

/*
The inequality operator (!=) is the opposite of the equality operator. It means not equal and returns false where equality would return true and vice versa. Like the equality operator, the inequality operator will convert data types of values while comparing.

Examples

1 !=  2    // true
1 != "1"   // false
1 != '1'   // false
1 != true  // false
0 != false // false
Add the inequality operator != in the if statement so that the function will return the string Not Equal when val is not equivalent to 99.

Examples

3 !==  3  // false
3 !== '3' // true
4 !==  3  // true
Add the strict inequality operator to the if statement so the function will return the string Not Equal when val is not strictly equal to 17

/*
The greater than operator (>) compares the values of two numbers. If the number to the left is greater than the number to the right, it returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.

Like the equality operator, the greater than operator will convert data types of values while comparing.

Examples

5   >  3  // true
7   > '3' // true
2   >  3  // false
'1' >  9  // false

// ___________________________________________ 75 Golf Code

/*
In the game of Golf, each hole has a par, meaning, the average number of strokes a golfer is expected to make in order to sink the ball in the hole to complete the play. Depending on how far above or below par your strokes are, there is a different nickname.

Your function will be passed par and strokes arguments. Return the correct string according to this table which lists the strokes in order of priority; top (highest) to bottom (lowest):

Strokes	Return
1	"Hole-in-one!"
<= par - 2	"Eagle"
par - 1	"Birdie"
par	"Par"
par + 1	"Bogey"
par + 2	"Double Bogey"
>= par + 3	"Go Home!"
par and strokes will always be numeric and positive. We have added an array of all the names for your convenience.
 */

  // Only change code above this line
}

golfScore(5, 4);
// ___________________________________________ 76 Selecting from Many Options with Switch Statements

/*
If you need to match one value against many options, you can use a switch statement. A switch statement compares the value to the case statements which define various possible values. Any valid JavaScript statements can be executed inside a case block and will run from the first matched case value until a break is encountered.

Here is an example of a switch statement:

switch (fruit) {
  case "apple":
    console.log("The fruit is an apple");
    break;
  case "orange":
    console.log("The fruit is an orange");
    break;
}
case values are tested with strict equality (===). The break tells JavaScript to stop executing statements. If the break is omitted, the next statement will be executed.

Write a switch statement which tests val and sets answer for the following conditions:
1 - alpha
2 - beta
3 - gamma
4 - delta
 */
function caseInSwitch(val) {
  let answer = "";
  // Only change code below this line
  switch(val) {
    case 1:
    answer = 'alpha'
    break;
    case 2:
    answer = 'beta'
    break;
    case 3:
    answer = 'gamma'
    break;
    case 4:
    answer = 'delta'
    break;
  }


  // Only change code above this line
  return answer;
}

caseInSwitch(1);
// ___________________________________________ 77 Adding a Default Option in Switch Statements

/*
In a switch statement you may not be able to specify all possible values as case statements. Instead, you can add the default statement which will be executed if no matching case statements are found. Think of it like the final else statement in an if/else chain.

A default statement should be the last case.

switch (num) {
  case value1:
    statement1;
    break;
  case value2:
    statement2;
    break;
...
  default:
    defaultStatement;
    break;
}
Write a switch statement to set answer for the following conditions:
a - apple
b - bird
c - cat
default - stuff
*/
function switchOfStuff(val) {
  let answer = "";
  // Only change code below this line
  switch (val) {
    case 'a':
      answer = 'apple';
      break;
    case 'b':
      answer = 'bird';
      break;
    case 'c':
      answer = 'cat';
      break;
    default:
      answer = 'stuff';
      break;
  }


  // Only change code above this line
  return answer;
}

switchOfStuff(1);
// ___________________________________________ 78 Multiple Identical Options in Switch Statements

/*
If the break statement is omitted from a switch statement's case, the following case statement(s) are executed until a break is encountered. If you have multiple inputs with the same output, you can represent them in a switch statement like this:

let result = "";
switch (val) {
  case 1:
  case 2:
  case 3:
    result = "1, 2, or 3";
    break;
  case 4:
    result = "4 alone";
}
Cases for 1, 2, and 3 will all produce the same result.

Write a switch statement to set answer for the following ranges:
1-3 - Low
4-6 - Mid
7-9 - High

Note: You will need to have a case statement for each number in the range.
 */
function sequentialSizes(val) {
  let answer = "";
  // Only change code below this line
  switch (val) {
    case 1:
    case 2:
    case 3:
      answer = 'Low';
      break;
    case 4:
    case 5:
    case 6:
      answer = 'Mid';
      break;
    case 7:
    case 8:
    case 9:
      answer = 'High';
      break;
  }


  // Only change code above this line
  return answer;
}

sequentialSizes(1);
// ___________________________________________ 79 Replacing If Else Chains with Switch

/*
If you have many options to choose from, a switch statement can be easier to write than many chained if/else if statements. The following:

  answer = "a";
} else if (val === 2) {

} else {
  answer = "c";

    break;
  case 2:
    answer = "b";
    break;
  default:
    answer = "c";

function chainToSwitch(val) {
  let answer = "";

// ___________________________________________ 80 Returning Boolean Values from Functions

/*
You may recall from Comparison with the Equality Operator that all comparison operators return a boolean true or false value.

Sometimes people use an if/else statement to do a comparison, like this:

function isEqual(a, b) {
  if (a === b) {
    return true;
  } else {
    return false;
  }
}
But there's a better way to do this. Since === returns true or false, we can return the result of the comparison:

function isEqual(a, b) {
  return a === b;
}
Fix the function isLess to remove the if/else statements.
*/
function isLess(a, b) {
  // Only change code below this line
  return a < b
  // Only change code above this line
}

isLess(10, 15);
// ___________________________________________ 81 Return Early Pattern for Functions

/*
When a return statement is reached, the execution of the current function stops and control returns to the calling location.

Example

function myFun() {
  console.log("Hello");
  return "World";
  console.log("byebye")
}
myFun();
The above will display the string Hello in the console, and return the string World. The string byebye will never display in the console, because the function exits at the return statement.

Modify the function abTest so that if a or b are less than 0 the function will immediately exit with a value of undefined.

Hint
Remember that undefined is a keyword, not a string.
*/
// Setup
function abTest(a, b) {
  // Only change code below this line
  if (a < 0 || b < 0) {
    return undefined
  }


  // Only change code above this line

  return Math.round(Math.pow(Math.sqrt(a) + Math.sqrt(b), 2));
}

abTest(2,2);
// ___________________________________________ 82 Counting Cards

/*
In the casino game Blackjack, a player can determine whether they have an advantage on the next hand over the house by keeping track of the relative number of high and low cards remaining in the deck. This is called Card Counting.

Having more high cards remaining in the deck favors the player. Each card is assigned a value according to the table below. When the count is positive, the player should bet high. When the count is zero or negative, the player should bet low.

Count Change	Cards
+1	2, 3, 4, 5, 6
0	7, 8, 9
-1	10, 'J', 'Q', 'K', 'A'
You will write a card counting function. It will receive a card parameter, which can be a number or a string, and increment or decrement the global count variable according to the card's value (see table). The function will then return a string with the current count and the string Bet if the count is positive, or Hold if the count is zero or negative. The current count and the player's decision (Bet or Hold) should be separated by a single space.

Example Outputs: -3 Hold or 5 Bet

Hint
Do NOT reset count to 0 when value is 7, 8, or 9.
Do NOT return an array.
Do NOT include quotes (single or double) in the output.
*/
let count = 0;

function cc(card) {
  // Only change code below this line
  switch (card) {
    case 2:
    case 3:
    case 4:
    case 5:
    case 6:
      count++
      break;
    case 10:
    case 'J':
    case 'Q':
    case 'K':
    case 'A':
      count--
      break;
    default:
      count
      break;

  return `${count} ${count > 0 ? 'Bet' : 'Hold'}`
  // Only change code above this line
}

cc(2); cc(3); cc(7); cc('K'); cc('A');
// ___________________________________________ 83 Build JavaScript Objects

/*
You may have heard the term object before.

Objects are similar to arrays, except that instead of using indexes to access and modify their data, you access the data in objects through what are called properties.

Objects are useful for storing data in a structured way, and can represent real world objects, like a cat.

Here's a sample cat object:

const cat = {
  "name": "Whiskers",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "enemies": ["Water", "Dogs"]
};
In this example, all the properties are stored as strings, such as name, legs, and tails. However, you can also use numbers as properties. You can even omit the quotes for single-word string properties, as follows:

const anotherObject = {
  make: "Ford",
  5: "five",
  "model": "focus"
};
However, if your object has any non-string properties, JavaScript will automatically typecast them as strings.

Make an object that represents a dog called myDog which contains the properties name (a string), legs, tails and friends.

You can set these object properties to whatever values you want, as long as name is a string, legs and tails are numbers, and friends is an array.
*/
const myDog = {
  // Only change code below this line
  name: 'Sharik',
  legs: 4,
  tails: 1,
  friends: ['Tobik', 'Rex']
  // Only change code above this line
};
// ___________________________________________ 84 Accessing Object Properties with Dot Notation

/*
There are two ways to access the properties of an object: dot notation (.) and bracket notation ([]), similar to an array.

Dot notation is what you use when you know the name of the property you're trying to access ahead of time.

Here is a sample of using dot notation (.) to read an object's property:

const myObj = {
  prop1: "val1",
  prop2: "val2"
};

const prop1val = myObj.prop1;
const prop2val = myObj.prop2;
prop1val would have a value of the string val1, and prop2val would have a value of the string val2.

Read in the property values of testObj using dot notation. Set the variable hatValue equal to the object's property hat and set the variable shirtValue equal to the object's property shirt.
*/
// Setup
const testObj = {
  "hat": "ballcap",
  "shirt": "jersey",
  "shoes": "cleats"
};

// Only change code below this line
const hatValue = testObj.hat;      // Change this line
const shirtValue = testObj.shirt;    // Change this line
// ___________________________________________ 85 Accessing Object Properties with Bracket Notation

/*
The second way to access the properties of an object is bracket notation ([]). If the property of the object you are trying to access has a space in its name, you will need to use bracket notation.

However, you can still use bracket notation on object properties without spaces.

Here is a sample of using bracket notation to read an object's property:

const myObj = {
  "Space Name": "Kirk",
  "More Space": "Spock",
  "NoSpace": "USS Enterprise"
};

myObj["Space Name"];
myObj['More Space'];
myObj["NoSpace"];
myObj["Space Name"] would be the string Kirk, myObj['More Space'] would be the string Spock, and myObj["NoSpace"] would be the string USS Enterprise.

Note that property names with spaces in them must be in quotes (single or double).

Read the values of the properties an entree and the drink of testObj using bracket notation and assign them to entreeValue and drinkValue respectively.
*/
// Setup
const testObj = {
  "an entree": "hamburger",
  "my side": "veggies",
  "the drink": "water"
};

// Only change code below this line
const entreeValue = testObj['an entree'];   // Change this line
const drinkValue = testObj['the drink'];    // Change this line
// ___________________________________________ 86 Accessing Object Properties with Variables

/*
Another use of bracket notation on objects is to access a property which is stored as the value of a variable. This can be very useful for iterating through an object's properties or when accessing a lookup table.

Here is an example of using a variable to access a property:

const dogs = {
  Fido: "Mutt",
  Hunter: "Doberman",
  Snoopie: "Beagle"
};

const myDog = "Hunter";
const myBreed = dogs[myDog];
console.log(myBreed);
The string Doberman would be displayed in the console.

Note that we do not use quotes around the variable name when using it to access the property because we are using the value of the variable, not the name.

Set the playerNumber variable to 16. Then, use the variable to look up the player's name and assign it to player.
*/
// Setup
const testObj = {
  12: "Namath",
  16: "Montana",
  19: "Unitas"
};

// Only change code below this line
const playerNumber = 16;  // Change this line
const player = testObj[playerNumber];   // Change this line
// ___________________________________________ 87 Updating Object Properties

/*
After you've created a JavaScript object, you can update its properties at any time just like you would update any other variable. You can use either dot or bracket notation to update.

For example, let's look at ourDog:

const ourDog = {
  "name": "Camper",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["everything!"]
};
Since he's a particularly happy dog, let's change his name to the string Happy Camper. Here's how we update his object's name property: ourDog.name = "Happy Camper"; or ourDog["name"] = "Happy Camper"; Now when we evaluate ourDog.name, instead of getting Camper, we'll get his new name, Happy Camper.

Update the myDog object's name property. Let's change her name from Coder to Happy Coder. You can use either dot or bracket notation.
*/
// Setup
const myDog = {
  "name": "Coder",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["freeCodeCamp Campers"]
};
myDog.name = 'Happy Coder'
// Only change code below this line

// ___________________________________________ 88 Add New Properties to a JavaScript Object
/*
You can add new properties to existing JavaScript objects the same way you would modify them.

Here's how we would add a bark property to ourDog:

ourDog.bark = "bow-wow";
or

ourDog["bark"] = "bow-wow";
Now when we evaluate ourDog.bark, we'll get his bark, bow-wow.

Example:

const ourDog = {
  "name": "Camper",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["everything!"]
};

ourDog.bark = "bow-wow";
Add a bark property to myDog and set it to a dog sound, such as "woof". You may use either dot or bracket notation.
*/
const myDog = {
  "name": "Happy Coder",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["freeCodeCamp Campers"]
};

myDog.bark = 'woof'

// ___________________________________________ 89 Delete Properties from a JavaScript Object

/*
We can also delete properties from objects like this:

delete ourDog.bark;
Example:

const ourDog = {
  "name": "Camper",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["everything!"],
  "bark": "bow-wow"
};

delete ourDog.bark;
After the last line shown above, ourDog looks like:

{
  "name": "Camper",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["everything!"]
}
Delete the tails property from myDog. You may use either dot or bracket notation.
*/
// Setup
const myDog = {
  "name": "Happy Coder",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["freeCodeCamp Campers"],
  "bark": "woof"
};
delete myDog.tails
// Only change code below this line

// ___________________________________________ 90 Using Objects for Lookups

/*
Objects can be thought of as a key/value storage, like a dictionary. If you have tabular data, you can use an object to lookup values rather than a switch statement or an if/else chain. This is most useful when you know that your input data is limited to a certain range.

Here is an example of an article object:

const article = {
  "title": "How to create objects in JavaScript",
  "link": "https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-complete-guide-to-creating-objects-in-javascript-b0e2450655e8/",
  "author": "Kaashan Hussain",
  "language": "JavaScript",
  "tags": "TECHNOLOGY",
  "createdAt": "NOVEMBER 28, 2018"
};

const articleAuthor = article["author"];
const articleLink = article["link"];

const value = "title";
const valueLookup = article[value];
articleAuthor is the string Kaashan Hussain, articleLink is the string https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-complete-guide-to-creating-objects-in-javascript-b0e2450655e8/, and valueLookup is the string How to create objects in JavaScript.

Convert the switch statement into an object called lookup. Use it to look up val and assign the associated string to the result variable.
*/
// Setup
function phoneticLookup(val) {
  let result = "";

  // Only change code below this line
  switch(val) {
    case "alpha":
      result = "Adams";
      break;
    case "bravo":
      result = "Boston";
      break;
    case "charlie":
      result = "Chicago";
      break;
    case "delta":
      result = "Denver";
      break;
    case "echo":
      result = "Easy";
      break;
    case "foxtrot":
      result = "Frank";
  }
  const lookup = {
    "alpha": "Adams",
    "bravo": "Boston",
    "charlie": "Chicago",
    "delta": "Denver",
    "echo": "Easy",
    "foxtrot": "Frank",
  }
  result = lookup[val]
  // Only change code above this line
  return result;
}

phoneticLookup("charlie");
// ___________________________________________ 91 Testing Objects for Properties

/*
To check if a property on a given object exists or not, you can use the .hasOwnProperty() method. someObject.hasOwnProperty(someProperty) returns true or false depending on if the property is found on the object or not.

Example

function checkForProperty(object, property) {
  return object.hasOwnProperty(property);
}

checkForProperty({ top: 'hat', bottom: 'pants' }, 'top'); // true
checkForProperty({ top: 'hat', bottom: 'pants' }, 'middle'); // false
The first checkForProperty function call returns true, while the second returns false.

Modify the function checkObj to test if the object passed to the function parameter obj contains the specific property passed to the function parameter checkProp. If the property passed to checkProp is found on obj, return that property's value. If not, return Not Found.
*/
function checkObj(obj, checkProp) {
  // Only change code below this line
  if (obj.hasOwnProperty(checkProp)) {
    return obj[checkProp]
  } else {
    return 'Not Found'
  }
  return "Change Me!";
  // Only change code above this line
}
// ___________________________________________ 92 Manipulating Complex Objects

/*
Sometimes you may want to store data in a flexible Data Structure. A JavaScript object is one way to handle flexible data. They allow for arbitrary combinations of strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, functions, and objects.

Here's an example of a complex data structure:

const ourMusic = [
  {
    "artist": "Daft Punk",
    "title": "Homework",
    "release_year": 1997,
    "formats": [ 
      "CD", 
      "Cassette", 
      "LP"
    ],
    "gold": true
  }
];
This is an array which contains one object inside. The object has various pieces of metadata about an album. It also has a nested formats array. If you want to add more album records, you can do this by adding records to the top level array. Objects hold data in a property, which has a key-value format. In the example above, "artist": "Daft Punk" is a property that has a key of artist and a value of Daft Punk.

Note: You will need to place a comma after every object in the array, unless it is the last object in the array.

Add a new album to the myMusic array. Add artist and title strings, release_year number, and a formats array of strings.
*/
const myMusic = [
  {
    "artist": "Billy Joel",
    "title": "Piano Man",
    "release_year": 1973,
    "formats": [
      "CD",
      "8T",
      "LP"
    ],
    "gold": true
  },
    {
    "artist": "Billy Joel",
    "title": "Piano Man",
    "release_year": 1973,
    "formats": [
      "CD",
      "8T",
      "LP"
    ],
    "gold": true
  },
];
// ___________________________________________ 93 Accessing Nested Objects

/*
The sub-properties of objects can be accessed by chaining together the dot or bracket notation.

Here is a nested object:

const ourStorage = {
  "desk": {
    "drawer": "stapler"
  },
  "cabinet": {
    "top drawer": { 
      "folder1": "a file",
      "folder2": "secrets"
    },
    "bottom drawer": "soda"
  }
};

ourStorage.cabinet["top drawer"].folder2;
ourStorage.desk.drawer;
ourStorage.cabinet["top drawer"].folder2 would be the string secrets, and ourStorage.desk.drawer would be the string stapler.

Access the myStorage object and assign the contents of the glove box property to the gloveBoxContents variable. Use dot notation for all properties where possible, otherwise use bracket notation.
*/
const myStorage = {
  "car": {
    "inside": {
      "glove box": "maps",
      "passenger seat": "crumbs"
     },
    "outside": {
      "trunk": "jack"
    }
  }
};

const gloveBoxContents = myStorage.car.inside['glove box'];
// ___________________________________________ 94 Accessing Nested Arrays

/*
As we have seen in earlier examples, objects can contain both nested objects and nested arrays. Similar to accessing nested objects, array bracket notation can be chained to access nested arrays.

Here is an example of how to access a nested array:

const ourPets = [
  {
    animalType: "cat",
    names: [
      "Meowzer",
      "Fluffy",
      "Kit-Cat"
    ]
  },
  {
    animalType: "dog",
    names: [
      "Spot",
      "Bowser",
      "Frankie"
    ]
  }
];

ourPets[0].names[1];
ourPets[1].names[0];
ourPets[0].names[1] would be the string Fluffy, and ourPets[1].names[0] would be the string Spot.

Using dot and bracket notation, set the variable secondTree to the second item in the trees list from the myPlants object.


*/
const myPlants = [
  {
    type: "flowers",
    list: [
      "rose",

/*
You are creating a function that aids in the maintenance of a musical album collection. The collection is organized as an object that contains multiple albums which are also objects. Each album is represented in the collection with a unique id as the property name. Within each album object, there are various properties describing information about the album. Not all albums have complete information.

The updateRecords function takes 4 arguments represented by the following function parameters:

records - an object containing several individual albums
id - a number representing a specific album in the records object
prop - a string representing the name of the album’s property to update
value - a string containing the information used to update the album’s property
Complete the function using the rules below to modify the object passed to the function.

Your function must always return the entire records object.
If value is an empty string, delete the given prop property from the album.
If prop isn't tracks and value isn't an empty string, assign the value to that album's prop.
If prop is tracks and value isn't an empty string, you need to update the album's tracks array. First, if the album does not have a tracks property, assign it an empty array. Then add the value as the last item in the album's tracks array.
Note: A copy of the recordCollection object is used for the tests. You should not directly modify the recordCollection object.

/*
You can run the same code multiple times by using a loop.

The first type of loop we will learn is called a while loop because it runs while a specified condition is true and stops once that condition is no longer true.

const ourArray = [];
let i = 0;

while (i < 5) {
  ourArray.push(i);
  i++;
}
In the code example above, the while loop will execute 5 times and append the numbers 0 through 4 to ourArray.

Let's try getting a while loop to work by pushing values to an array.

Add the numbers 5 through 0 (inclusive) in descending order to myArray using a while loop.
*/
// Setup
const myArray = [];
let i = 5;
while (i >= 0) {
  myArray.push(i);
  i--;
}
// Only change code below this line

// ___________________________________________ 97 Iterate with JavaScript For Loops

/*
You can run the same code multiple times by using a loop.

The most common type of JavaScript loop is called a for loop because it runs for a specific number of times.

For loops are declared with three optional expressions separated by semicolons:

for (a; b; c), where a is the initialization statement, b is the condition statement, and c is the final expression.

The initialization statement is executed one time only before the loop starts. It is typically used to define and setup your loop variable.

The condition statement is evaluated at the beginning of every loop iteration and will continue as long as it evaluates to true. When the condition is false at the start of the iteration, the loop will stop executing. This means if the condition starts as false, your loop will never execute.

The final expression is executed at the end of each loop iteration, prior to the next condition check and is usually used to increment or decrement your loop counter.

In the following example we initialize with i = 0 and iterate while our condition i < 5 is true. We'll increment i by 1 in each loop iteration with i++ as our final expression.

const ourArray = [];

for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  ourArray.push(i);
}
ourArray will now have the value [0, 1, 2, 3, 4].

Use a for loop to push the values 1 through 5 onto myArray.
*/
// Setup
const myArray = [];
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  myArray.push(i);

// ___________________________________________ 98 Iterate Odd Numbers With a For Loop

/*
For loops don't have to iterate one at a time. By changing our final-expression, we can count by even numbers.

We'll start at i = 0 and loop while i < 10. We'll increment i by 2 each loop with i += 2.

const ourArray = [];

for (let i = 0; i < 10; i += 2) {
  ourArray.push(i);
}
ourArray will now contain [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]. Let's change our initialization so we can count by odd numbers.

Push the odd numbers from 1 through 9 to myArray using a for loop.

// Setup
const myArray = [];
for (let i = 1; i < 10; i += 2) {
  myArray.push(i);
}

// ___________________________________________ 99 Count Backwards With a For Loop

/*
A for loop can also count backwards, so long as we can define the right conditions.

In order to decrement by two each iteration, we'll need to change our initialization, condition, and final expression.

We'll start at i = 10 and loop while i > 0. We'll decrement i by 2 each loop with i -= 2.

const ourArray = [];

for (let i = 10; i > 0; i -= 2) {
  ourArray.push(i);
}
ourArray will now contain [10, 8, 6, 4, 2]. Let's change our initialization and final expression so we can count backwards by twos to create an array of descending odd numbers.

Push the odd numbers from 9 through 1 to myArray using a for loop.

// Setup
const myArray = [];
for (let i = 9; i > 0; i -= 2) {
  myArray.push(i);
}
// Only change code below this line

// ___________________________________________ 100 Iterate Through an Array with a For Loop

/*
A common task in JavaScript is to iterate through the contents of an array. One way to do that is with a for loop. This code will output each element of the array arr to the console:

const arr = [10, 9, 8, 7, 6];

for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
   console.log(arr[i]);
}
Remember that arrays have zero-based indexing, which means the last index of the array is length - 1. Our condition for this loop is i < arr.length, which stops the loop when i is equal to length. In this case the last iteration is i === 4 i.e. when i becomes equal to arr.length - 1 and outputs 6 to the console. Then i increases to 5, and the loop terminates because i < arr.length is false.

Declare and initialize a variable total to 0. Use a for loop to add the value of each element of the myArr array to total.
*/
// Setup
const myArr = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
let total = 0;
for (let i = 0; i < myArr.length; i++) {
   total += myArr[i]
}
// Only change code below this line

// ___________________________________________ 101 Nesting For Loops

/*
If you have a multi-dimensional array, you can use the same logic as the prior waypoint to loop through both the array and any sub-arrays. Here is an example:

const arr = [
  [1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]
];

for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
  for (let j = 0; j < arr[i].length; j++) {
    console.log(arr[i][j]);
  }
}
This outputs each sub-element in arr one at a time. Note that for the inner loop, we are checking the .length of arr[i], since arr[i] is itself an array.

Modify function multiplyAll so that it returns the product of all the numbers in the sub-arrays of arr.
*/
function multiplyAll(arr) {
  let product = 1;
  // Only change code below this line
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
  for (let j = 0; j < arr[i].length; j++) {
    product *= arr[i][j] 
  }
}
  // Only change code above this line
  return product;
}

multiplyAll([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6, 7]]);
// ___________________________________________ 102 Iterate with JavaScript Do...While Loops

/*
The next type of loop you will learn is called a do...while loop. It is called a do...while loop because it will first do one pass of the code inside the loop no matter what, and then continue to run the loop while the specified condition evaluates to true.

const ourArray = [];
let i = 0;

do {
  ourArray.push(i);
  i++;
} while (i < 5);
The example above behaves similar to other types of loops, and the resulting array will look like [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]. However, what makes the do...while different from other loops is how it behaves when the condition fails on the first check. Let's see this in action. Here is a regular while loop that will run the code in the loop as long as i < 5:

const ourArray = []; 
let i = 5;

while (i < 5) {
  ourArray.push(i);
  i++;
}
In this example, we initialize the value of ourArray to an empty array and the value of i to 5. When we execute the while loop, the condition evaluates to false because i is not less than 5, so we do not execute the code inside the loop. The result is that ourArray will end up with no values added to it, and it will still look like [] when all of the code in the example above has completed running. Now, take a look at a do...while loop:

const ourArray = []; 
let i = 5;

do {
  ourArray.push(i);
  i++;
} while (i < 5);
In this case, we initialize the value of i to 5, just like we did with the while loop. When we get to the next line, there is no condition to evaluate, so we go to the code inside the curly braces and execute it. We will add a single element to the array and then increment i before we get to the condition check. When we finally evaluate the condition i < 5 on the last line, we see that i is now 6, which fails the conditional check, so we exit the loop and are done. At the end of the above example, the value of ourArray is [5]. Essentially, a do...while loop ensures that the code inside the loop will run at least once. Let's try getting a do...while loop to work by pushing values to an array.

Change the while loop in the code to a do...while loop so the loop will push only the number 10 to myArray, and i will be equal to 11 when your code has finished running.

// Setup
const myArray = [];
let i = 10;

// Only change code below this line
do {
  myArray.push(i);
  i++;
}
while (i < 10) 
// ___________________________________________ 103 Replace Loops using Recursion

/*
Recursion is the concept that a function can be expressed in terms of itself. To help understand this, start by thinking about the following task: multiply the first n elements of an array to create the product of those elements. Using a for loop, you could do this:

  function multiply(arr, n) {
    let product = 1;
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      product *= arr[i];
    }
    return product;
  }
However, notice that multiply(arr, n) == multiply(arr, n - 1) * arr[n - 1]. That means you can rewrite multiply in terms of itself and never need to use a loop.

  function multiply(arr, n) {
    if (n <= 0) {
      return 1;
    } else {
      return multiply(arr, n - 1) * arr[n - 1];
    }
  }
The recursive version of multiply breaks down like this. In the base case, where n <= 0, it returns 1. For larger values of n, it calls itself, but with n - 1. That function call is evaluated in the same way, calling multiply again until n <= 0. At this point, all the functions can return and the original multiply returns the answer.

Note: Recursive functions must have a base case when they return without calling the function again (in this example, when n <= 0), otherwise they can never finish executing.

Write a recursive function, sum(arr, n), that returns the sum of the first n elements of an array arr.

function sum(arr, n) {
  // Only change code below this line
    if (n <= 0) {

You can generate random decimal numbers with Math.random(), but sometimes you need to generate random whole numbers. The following process will give you a random whole number less than 20:

Use Math.random() to generate a random decimal number.
Multiply that random decimal number by 20.
Use Math.floor() to round this number down to its nearest whole number.
Remember that Math.random() can never quite return a 1, so it's impossible to actually get 20 since you are rounding down with Math.floor(). This process will give you a random whole number in the range from 0 to 19.

Putting everything together, this is what your code looks like:

Math.floor(Math.random() * 20);
You are calling Math.random(), multiplying the result by 20, then passing the value to Math.floor() to round the value down to the nearest whole number.

// ___________________________________________ 110 Use the Conditional (Ternary) Operator

/*
The conditional operator, also called the ternary operator, can be used as a one line if-else expression.

The syntax is a ? b : c, where a is the condition, b is the code to run when the condition returns true, and c is the code to run when the condition returns false.

The following function uses an if/else statement to check a condition:

function findGreater(a, b) {
  if(a > b) {
    return "a is greater";
  }
  else {
    return "b is greater or equal";
  }
}
This can be re-written using the conditional operator:

function findGreater(a, b) {
  return a > b ? "a is greater" : "b is greater or equal";
}
Use the conditional operator in the checkEqual function to check if two numbers are equal or not. The function should return either the string Equal or the string Not Equal.
*/
function checkEqual(a, b) {
  return a === b ? 'Equal' : 'Not Equal';
}

checkEqual(1, 2);
// ___________________________________________ 111 Use Multiple Conditional (Ternary) Operators

/*
In the previous challenge, you used a single conditional operator. You can also chain them together to check for multiple conditions.

The following function uses if, else if, and else statements to check multiple conditions:

function findGreaterOrEqual(a, b) {
  if (a === b) {
    return "a and b are equal";
  }
  else if (a > b) {
    return "a is greater";
  }
  else {
    return "b is greater";
  }
}
The above function can be re-written using multiple conditional operators:

function findGreaterOrEqual(a, b) {
  return (a === b) ? "a and b are equal" 
    : (a > b) ? "a is greater" 
    : "b is greater";
}
It is considered best practice to format multiple conditional operators such that each condition is on a separate line, as shown above. Using multiple conditional operators without proper indentation may make your code hard to read. For example:

function findGreaterOrEqual(a, b) {
  return (a === b) ? "a and b are equal" : (a > b) ? "a is greater" : "b is greater";
}
In the checkSign function, use multiple conditional operators - following the recommended format used in findGreaterOrEqual - to check if a number is positive, negative or zero. The function should return positive, negative or zero.

  return num > 0 ? 'positive' : num < 0 ? 'negative' : 'zero'
}

checkSign(10);
// ___________________________________________ 112 Use Recursion to Create a Countdown
 
/*
In a previous challenge, you learned how to use recursion to replace a for loop. Now, let's look at a more complex function that returns an array of consecutive integers starting with 1 through the number passed to the function.

As mentioned in the previous challenge, there will be a base case. The base case tells the recursive function when it no longer needs to call itself. It is a simple case where the return value is already known. There will also be a recursive call which executes the original function with different arguments. If the function is written correctly, eventually the base case will be reached.

For example, say you want to write a recursive function that returns an array containing the numbers 1 through n. This function will need to accept an argument, n, representing the final number. Then it will need to call itself with progressively smaller values of n until it reaches 1. You could write the function as follows:

function countup(n) {
  if (n < 1) {
    return [];
  } else {
    const countArray = countup(n - 1);
    countArray.push(n);
    return countArray;
  }
}
console.log(countup(5));
The value [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] will be displayed in the console.

At first, this seems counterintuitive since the value of n decreases, but the values in the final array are increasing. This happens because the push happens last, after the recursive call has returned. At the point where n is pushed into the array, countup(n - 1) has already been evaluated and returned [1, 2, ..., n - 1].

We have defined a function called countdown with one parameter (n). The function should use recursion to return an array containing the integers n through 1 based on the n parameter. If the function is called with a number less than 1, the function should return an empty array. For example, calling this function with n = 5 should return the array [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]. Your function must use recursion by calling itself and must not use loops of any kind.
*/
// Only change code below this line
function countdown(n){
  if (n < 1) {
    return [];
  } else {
    const countArray = countdown(n - 1);
    countArray.unshift(n);
    return countArray;
  }
}
// Only change code above this line

/*
Continuing from the previous challenge, we provide you another opportunity to create a recursive function to solve a problem.

The function should return an array of integers which begins with a number represented by the startNum parameter and ends with a number represented by the endNum parameter. The starting number will always be less than or equal to the ending number. Your function must use recursion by calling itself and not use loops of any kind. It should also work for cases where both startNum and endNum are the same.

  if (startNum === endNum) {

// ___________________________________________ 1 Compare Scopes of the var and let Keywords


/*
Compare Scopes of the var and let Keywords
If you are unfamiliar with let, check out this challenge about the difference between let and var.

When you declare a variable with the var keyword, it is declared globally, or locally if declared inside a function.

The let keyword behaves similarly, but with some extra features. When you declare a variable with the let keyword inside a block, statement, or expression, its scope is limited to that block, statement, or expression.

For example:

var numArray = [];
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  numArray.push(i);
}
console.log(numArray);
console.log(i);
Here the console will display the values [0, 1, 2] and 3.

With the var keyword, i is declared globally. So when i++ is executed, it updates the global variable. This code is similar to the following:

var numArray = [];
var i;
for (i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  numArray.push(i);
}
console.log(numArray);
console.log(i);
Here the console will display the values [0, 1, 2] and 3.

This behavior will cause problems if you were to create a function and store it for later use inside a for loop that uses the i variable. This is because the stored function will always refer to the value of the updated global i variable.

var printNumTwo;
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  if (i === 2) {
    printNumTwo = function() {
      return i;
    };
  }
}
console.log(printNumTwo());
Here the console will display the value 3.

As you can see, printNumTwo() prints 3 and not 2. This is because the value assigned to i was updated and the printNumTwo() returns the global i and not the value i had when the function was created in the for loop. The let keyword does not follow this behavior:

let printNumTwo;
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  if (i === 2) {
    printNumTwo = function() {
      return i;
    };
  }
}
console.log(printNumTwo());
console.log(i);
Here the console will display the value 2, and an error that i is not defined.

i is not defined because it was not declared in the global scope. It is only declared within the for loop statement. printNumTwo() returned the correct value because three different i variables with unique values (0, 1, and 2) were created by the let keyword within the loop statement.

Fix the code so that i declared in the if statement is a separate variable than i declared in the first line of the function. Be certain not to use the var keyword anywhere in your code.

This exercise is designed to illustrate the difference between how var and let keywords assign scope to the declared variable. When programming a function similar to the one used in this exercise, it is often better to use different variable names to avoid confusion.
*/
function checkScope() {
  let i = 'function scope';
  if (true) {
    let i = 'block scope';
    console.log('Block scope i is: ', i);
  }
  console.log('Function scope i is: ', i);
  return i;
}
// ___________________________________________ 2 Mutate an Array Declared with const

/*
If you are unfamiliar with const, check out this challenge about the const keyword.

The const declaration has many use cases in modern JavaScript.

Some developers prefer to assign all their variables using const by default, unless they know they will need to reassign the value. Only in that case, they use let.

However, it is important to understand that objects (including arrays and functions) assigned to a variable using const are still mutable. Using the const declaration only prevents reassignment of the variable identifier.

const s = [5, 6, 7];
s = [1, 2, 3];
s[2] = 45;
console.log(s);
s = [1, 2, 3] will result in an error. After commenting out that line, the console.log will display the value [5, 6, 45].

As you can see, you can mutate the object [5, 6, 7] itself and the variable s will still point to the altered array [5, 6, 45]. Like all arrays, the array elements in s are mutable, but because const was used, you cannot use the variable identifier s to point to a different array using the assignment operator.

An array is declared as const s = [5, 7, 2]. Change the array to [2, 5, 7] using various element assignments.
*/
const s = [5, 7, 2];
function editInPlace() {
  // Only change code below this line
s[0] = 2;
s[1] = 5;
s[2] = 7;
  // Using s = [2, 5, 7] would be invalid

  // Only change code above this line
}
editInPlace();
// ___________________________________________ 3 Prevent Object Mutation

/*
As seen in the previous challenge, const declaration alone doesn't really protect your data from mutation. To ensure your data doesn't change, JavaScript provides a function Object.freeze to prevent data mutation.

Any attempt at changing the object will be rejected, with an error thrown if the script is running in strict mode.

let obj = {
  name:"FreeCodeCamp",
  review:"Awesome"
};
Object.freeze(obj);
obj.review = "bad";
obj.newProp = "Test";
console.log(obj); 
The obj.review and obj.newProp assignments will result in errors, because our editor runs in strict mode by default, and the console will display the value { name: "FreeCodeCamp", review: "Awesome" }.

In this challenge you are going to use Object.freeze to prevent mathematical constants from changing. You need to freeze the MATH_CONSTANTS object so that no one is able to alter the value of PI, add, or delete properties.
*/
function freezeObj() {
  const MATH_CONSTANTS = {
    PI: 3.14
  };
  // Only change code below this line
Object.freeze(MATH_CONSTANTS);

  // Only change code above this line
  try {
    MATH_CONSTANTS.PI = 99;
  } catch(ex) {
    console.log(ex);
  }
  return MATH_CONSTANTS.PI;
}
const PI = freezeObj();
// ___________________________________________ 4 Use Arrow Functions to Write Concise Anonymous Functions

/*
In JavaScript, we often don't need to name our functions, especially when passing a function as an argument to another function. Instead, we create inline functions. We don't need to name these functions because we do not reuse them anywhere else.

To achieve this, we often use the following syntax:

const myFunc = function() {
  const myVar = "value";
  return myVar;
}
ES6 provides us with the syntactic sugar to not have to write anonymous functions this way. Instead, you can use arrow function syntax:

const myFunc = () => {
  const myVar = "value";
  return myVar;
}
When there is no function body, and only a return value, arrow function syntax allows you to omit the keyword return as well as the brackets surrounding the code. This helps simplify smaller functions into one-line statements:

const myFunc = () => "value";
This code will still return the string value by default.

Rewrite the function assigned to the variable magic which returns a new Date() to use arrow function syntax. Also, make sure nothing is defined using the keyword var.
*/
const magic = () => new Date();
// ___________________________________________ 5 Write Arrow Functions with Parameters

/*
Just like a regular function, you can pass arguments into an arrow function.

const doubler = (item) => item * 2;
doubler(4);
doubler(4) would return the value 8.

If an arrow function has a single parameter, the parentheses enclosing the parameter may be omitted.

const doubler = item => item * 2;
It is possible to pass more than one argument into an arrow function.

const multiplier = (item, multi) => item * multi;
multiplier(4, 2);
multiplier(4, 2) would return the value 8.

Rewrite the myConcat function which appends contents of arr2 to arr1 so that the function uses arrow function syntax.
*/
const myConcat = (arr1, arr2) => arr1.concat(arr2);

console.log(myConcat([1, 2], [3, 4, 5]));
// ___________________________________________ 6 Set Default Parameters for Your Functions

/*
In order to help us create more flexible functions, ES6 introduces default parameters for functions.

Check out this code:

const greeting = (name = "Anonymous") => "Hello " + name;

console.log(greeting("John"));
console.log(greeting());
The console will display the strings Hello John and Hello Anonymous.

The default parameter kicks in when the argument is not specified (it is undefined). As you can see in the example above, the parameter name will receive its default value Anonymous when you do not provide a value for the parameter. You can add default values for as many parameters as you want.

Modify the function increment by adding default parameters so that it will add 1 to number if value is not specified.
*/
// Only change code below this line
const increment = (number, value = 1) => number + value;
// Only change code above this line
// ___________________________________________ 7 Use the Rest Parameter with Function Parameters

/*
In order to help us create more flexible functions, ES6 introduces the rest parameter for function parameters. With the rest parameter, you can create functions that take a variable number of arguments. These arguments are stored in an array that can be accessed later from inside the function.

Check out this code:

function howMany(...args) {
  return "You have passed " + args.length + " arguments.";
}
console.log(howMany(0, 1, 2));
console.log(howMany("string", null, [1, 2, 3], { }));
The console would display the strings You have passed 3 arguments. and You have passed 4 arguments..

The rest parameter eliminates the need to use the arguments object and allows us to use array methods on the array of parameters passed to the function howMany.

Modify the function sum using the rest parameter in such a way that the function sum is able to take any number of arguments and return their sum.
*/
const sum = (...args) => {
  let total = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < args.length; i++) {
    total += args[i];
  }
  return total;
}
// ___________________________________________ 8 Use the Spread Operator to Evaluate Arrays In-Place

/*
ES6 introduces the spread operator, which allows us to expand arrays and other expressions in places where multiple parameters or elements are expected.

The ES5 code below uses apply() to compute the maximum value in an array:

var arr = [6, 89, 3, 45];
var maximus = Math.max.apply(null, arr);
maximus would have a value of 89.

We had to use Math.max.apply(null, arr) because Math.max(arr) returns NaN. Math.max() expects comma-separated arguments, but not an array. The spread operator makes this syntax much better to read and maintain.

const arr = [6, 89, 3, 45];
const maximus = Math.max(...arr);
maximus would have a value of 89.

...arr returns an unpacked array. In other words, it spreads the array. However, the spread operator only works in-place, like in an argument to a function or in an array literal. For example:

const spreaded = [...arr];
However, the following code will not work:

const spreaded = ...arr;
Copy all contents of arr1 into another array arr2 using the spread operator.
*/
const arr1 = ['JAN', 'FEB', 'MAR', 'APR', 'MAY'];
let arr2;

arr2 = [...arr1];  // Change this line

console.log(arr2);
// ___________________________________________ 9 Use Destructuring Assignment to Extract Values from Objects

/*
Destructuring assignment is special syntax introduced in ES6, for neatly assigning values taken directly from an object.

Consider the following ES5 code:

const user = { name: 'John Doe', age: 34 };

const name = user.name;
const age = user.age;
name would have a value of the string John Doe, and age would have the number 34.

Here's an equivalent assignment statement using the ES6 destructuring syntax:

const { name, age } = user;
Again, name would have a value of the string John Doe, and age would have the number 34.

Here, the name and age variables will be created and assigned the values of their respective values from the user object. You can see how much cleaner this is.

You can extract as many or few values from the object as you want.

Replace the two assignments with an equivalent destructuring assignment. It should still assign the variables today and tomorrow the values of today and tomorrow from the HIGH_TEMPERATURES object.
*/
const HIGH_TEMPERATURES = {
  yesterday: 75,
  today: 77,
  tomorrow: 80
};

// Only change code below this line

const {today, tomorrow} = HIGH_TEMPERATURES;

// Only change code above this line
// ___________________________________________ 10 Use Destructuring Assignment to Assign Variables from Objects              

/*
Destructuring allows you to assign a new variable name when extracting values. You can do this by putting the new name after a colon when assigning the value.

Using the same object from the last example:

const user = { name: 'John Doe', age: 34 };
Here's how you can give new variable names in the assignment:

const { name: userName, age: userAge } = user;
You may read it as "get the value of user.name and assign it to a new variable named userName" and so on. The value of userName would be the string John Doe, and the value of userAge would be the number 34.

Replace the two assignments with an equivalent destructuring assignment. It should still assign the variables highToday and highTomorrow the values of today and tomorrow from the HIGH_TEMPERATURES object.
*/
const HIGH_TEMPERATURES = {
  yesterday: 75,
  today: 77,
  tomorrow: 80
};

// Only change code below this line
const {today: highToday, tomorrow: highTomorrow} = HIGH_TEMPERATURES

// Only change code above this line
// ___________________________________________ 11 Use Destructuring Assignment to Assign Variables from Nested Objects

/*
You can use the same principles from the previous two lessons to destructure values from nested objects.

Using an object similar to previous examples:

const user = {
  johnDoe: { 
    age: 34,
    email: 'johnDoe@freeCodeCamp.com'
  }
};
Here's how to extract the values of object properties and assign them to variables with the same name:

const { johnDoe: { age, email }} = user;
And here's how you can assign an object properties' values to variables with different names:

const { johnDoe: { age: userAge, email: userEmail }} = user;
Replace the two assignments with an equivalent destructuring assignment. It should still assign the variables lowToday and highToday the values of today.low and today.high from the LOCAL_FORECAST object.
*/
const LOCAL_FORECAST = {
  yesterday: { low: 61, high: 75 },
  today: { low: 64, high: 77 },
  tomorrow: { low: 68, high: 80 }
};

// Only change code below this line
  
const { today: { low: lowToday, high: highToday } } = LOCAL_FORECAST;

// Only change code above this line
// ___________________________________________ 12 Use Destructuring Assignment to Assign Variables from Arrays

/*
ES6 makes destructuring arrays as easy as destructuring objects.

One key difference between the spread operator and array destructuring is that the spread operator unpacks all contents of an array into a comma-separated list. Consequently, you cannot pick or choose which elements you want to assign to variables.

Destructuring an array lets us do exactly that:

const [a, b] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
console.log(a, b);
The console will display the values of a and b as 1, 2.

The variable a is assigned the first value of the array, and b is assigned the second value of the array. We can also access the value at any index in an array with destructuring by using commas to reach the desired index:

const [a, b,,, c] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
console.log(a, b, c);
The console will display the values of a, b, and c as 1, 2, 5.

Use destructuring assignment to swap the values of a and b so that a receives the value stored in b, and b receives the value stored in a.
*/
let a = 8, b = 6;
// Only change code below this line
[b,a] = [a,b]
// ___________________________________________ 13 Destructuring via rest elements

/*
In some situations involving array destructuring, we might want to collect the rest of the elements into a separate array.

The result is similar to Array.prototype.slice(), as shown below:

const [a, b, ...arr] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7];
console.log(a, b);
console.log(arr);
The console would display the values 1, 2 and [3, 4, 5, 7].

Variables a and b take the first and second values from the array. After that, because of the rest syntax presence, arr gets the rest of the values in the form of an array. The rest element only works correctly as the last variable in the list. As in, you cannot use the rest syntax to catch a subarray that leaves out the last element of the original array.

Use a destructuring assignment with the rest syntax to emulate the behavior of Array.prototype.slice(). removeFirstTwo() should return a sub-array of the original array list with the first two elements omitted.
*/
function removeFirstTwo(list) {
    let [a,b,...rest] = list
    return rest;
}

const source = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
const sourceWithoutFirstTwo = removeFirstTwo(source);
// ___________________________________________ 14 Use Destructuring Assignment to Pass an Object as a Function's Parameters

/*
In some cases, you can destructure the object in a function argument itself.

Consider the code below:

const profileUpdate = (profileData) => {
  const { name, age, nationality, location } = profileData;

}
This effectively destructures the object sent into the function. This can also be done in-place:

const profileUpdate = ({ name, age, nationality, location }) => {

}
When profileData is passed to the above function, the values are destructured from the function parameter for use within the function.

Use destructuring assignment within the argument to the function half to send only max and min inside the function.
*/
const stats = {
  max: 56.78,
  standard_deviation: 4.34,
  median: 34.54,
  mode: 23.87,
  min: -0.75,
  average: 35.85
};

// Only change code below this line
const half = ({max,min}) => (max + min) / 2.0;
// Only change code above this line
// ___________________________________________ 15 Create Strings using Template Literals

/*
A new feature of ES6 is the template literal. This is a special type of string that makes creating complex strings easier.

Template literals allow you to create multi-line strings and to use string interpolation features to create strings.

Consider the code below:

const person = {
  name: "Zodiac Hasbro",
  age: 56
};

const greeting = `Hello, my name is ${person.name}!
I am ${person.age} years old.`;

console.log(greeting);
The console will display the strings Hello, my name is Zodiac Hasbro! and I am 56 years old..

A lot of things happened there. Firstly, the example uses backticks (`), not quotes (' or "), to wrap the string. Secondly, notice that the string is multi-line, both in the code and the output. This saves inserting \n within strings. The ${variable} syntax used above is a placeholder. Basically, you won't have to use concatenation with the + operator anymore. To add variables to strings, you just drop the variable in a template string and wrap it with ${ and }. Similarly, you can include other expressions in your string literal, for example ${a + b}. This new way of creating strings gives you more flexibility to create robust strings.

Use template literal syntax with backticks to create an array of list element (li) strings. Each list element's text should be one of the array elements from the failure property on the result object and have a class attribute with the value text-warning. The makeList function should return the array of list item strings.

Use an iterator method (any kind of loop) to get the desired output (shown below).

[
  '<li class="text-warning">no-var</li>',
  '<li class="text-warning">var-on-top</li>',
  '<li class="text-warning">linebreak</li>'
]
*/
const result = {
  success: ["max-length", "no-amd", "prefer-arrow-functions"],
  failure: ["no-var", "var-on-top", "linebreak"],
  skipped: ["no-extra-semi", "no-dup-keys"]
};
function makeList(arr) {
  // Only change code below this line
  const failureItems = arr.map((f,i) => `<li class="text-warning">${f}</li>`)
  // Only change code above this line

  return failureItems;
}

const failuresList = makeList(result.failure);
// ___________________________________________ 16 Write Concise Object Literal Declarations Using Object Property Shorthand

/*
ES6 adds some nice support for easily defining object literals.

Consider the following code:

const getMousePosition = (x, y) => ({
  x: x,
  y: y
});
getMousePosition is a simple function that returns an object containing two properties. ES6 provides the syntactic sugar to eliminate the redundancy of having to write x: x. You can simply write x once, and it will be converted tox: x (or something equivalent) under the hood. Here is the same function from above rewritten to use this new syntax:

const getMousePosition = (x, y) => ({ x, y });
Use object property shorthand with object literals to create and return an object with name, age and gender properties.
*/
const createPerson = (name, age, gender) => {
  // Only change code below this line
  return {
    name,
    age,
    gender
  };
  // Only change code above this line
};
// ___________________________________________ 17 Write Concise Declarative Functions with ES6

/*
When defining functions within objects in ES5, we have to use the keyword function as follows:

const person = {
  name: "Taylor",
  sayHello: function() {
    return `Hello! My name is ${this.name}.`;
  }
};
With ES6, you can remove the function keyword and colon altogether when defining functions in objects. Here's an example of this syntax:

const person = {
  name: "Taylor",
  sayHello() {
    return `Hello! My name is ${this.name}.`;
  }
};
Refactor the function setGear inside the object bicycle to use the shorthand syntax described above.
*/
// Only change code below this line
const bicycle = {
  gear: 2,
  setGear(newGear) {
    this.gear = newGear;
  }
};
// Only change code above this line
bicycle.setGear(3);
console.log(bicycle.gear);
// ___________________________________________ 18 Use class Syntax to Define a Constructor Function

/*
ES6 provides a new syntax to create objects, using the class keyword.

In ES5, an object can be created by defining a constructor function and using the new keyword to instantiate the object.

In ES6, a class declaration has a constructor method that is invoked with the new keyword. If the constructor method is not explicitly defined, then it is implicitly defined with no arguments.

// Explicit constructor
class SpaceShuttle {
  constructor(targetPlanet) {
    this.targetPlanet = targetPlanet;
  }
  takeOff() {
    console.log("To " + this.targetPlanet + "!");
  }
}

// Implicit constructor
class Rocket {
  launch() {
    console.log("To the moon!");
  }
}

const zeus = new SpaceShuttle('Jupiter');
// prints To Jupiter! in console
zeus.takeOff();

const atlas = new Rocket();
// prints To the moon! in console
atlas.launch();
It should be noted that the class keyword declares a new function, to which a constructor is added. This constructor is invoked when new is called to create a new object.

Note: UpperCamelCase should be used by convention for ES6 class names, as in SpaceShuttle used above.

The constructor method is a special method for creating and initializing an object created with a class. You will learn more about it in the Object Oriented Programming section of the JavaScript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification.

Use the class keyword and write a constructor to create the Vegetable class.

The Vegetable class allows you to create a vegetable object with a property name that gets passed to the constructor.
*/
// Only change code below this line
class Vegetable {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}
// Only change code above this line

const carrot = new Vegetable('carrot');
console.log(carrot.name); // Should display 'carrot'
// ___________________________________________ 19 Use getters and setters to Control Access to an Object

/*
You can obtain values from an object and set the value of a property within an object.

These are classically called getters and setters.

Getter functions are meant to simply return (get) the value of an object's private variable to the user without the user directly accessing the private variable.

Setter functions are meant to modify (set) the value of an object's private variable based on the value passed into the setter function. This change could involve calculations, or even overwriting the previous value completely.

class Book {
  constructor(author) {
    this._author = author;
  }
  // getter
  get writer() {
    return this._author;
  }
  // setter
  set writer(updatedAuthor) {
    this._author = updatedAuthor;
  }
}
const novel = new Book('anonymous');
console.log(novel.writer);
novel.writer = 'newAuthor';
console.log(novel.writer);
The console would display the strings anonymous and newAuthor.

Notice the syntax used to invoke the getter and setter. They do not even look like functions. Getters and setters are important because they hide internal implementation details.

Note: It is convention to precede the name of a private variable with an underscore (_). However, the practice itself does not make a variable private.

Use the class keyword to create a Thermostat class. The constructor accepts a Fahrenheit temperature.

In the class, create a getter to obtain the temperature in Celsius and a setter to set the temperature in Celsius.

Remember that C = 5/9 * (F - 32) and F = C * 9.0 / 5 + 32, where F is the value of temperature in Fahrenheit, and C is the value of the same temperature in Celsius.

Note: When you implement this, you will track the temperature inside the class in one scale, either Fahrenheit or Celsius.

This is the power of a getter and a setter. You are creating an API for another user, who can get the correct result regardless of which one you track.

In other words, you are abstracting implementation details from the user.
*/
// Only change code below this line
class Thermostat {
  constructor(fahrenheit) {
    this._temperature = fahrenheit;
  }
  get temperature() {
    return 5/9 * (this._temperature - 32);

    this._temperature = celsius * 9/5 + 32;
  }

// ___________________________________________ 20 Create a Module Script

/*
JavaScript started with a small role to play on an otherwise mostly HTML web. Today, it’s huge, and some websites are built almost entirely with JavaScript. In order to make JavaScript more modular, clean, and maintainable; ES6 introduced a way to easily share code among JavaScript files. This involves exporting parts of a file for use in one or more other files, and importing the parts you need, where you need them. In order to take advantage of this functionality, you need to create a script in your HTML document with a type of module. Here’s an example:

<script type="module" src="filename.js"></script>
A script that uses this module type can now use the import and export features you will learn about in the upcoming challenges.

Add a script to the HTML document of type module and give it the source file of index.js

<script type="module" src="index.js"></script>
<!-- Only change code above this line -->
</body>
</html>
// ___________________________________________ 21 Use export to Share a Code Block

/*
Imagine a file called math_functions.js that contains several functions related to mathematical operations. One of them is stored in a variable, add, that takes in two numbers and returns their sum. You want to use this function in several different JavaScript files. In order to share it with these other files, you first need to export it.

export const add = (x, y) => {
  return x + y;
}
The above is a common way to export a single function, but you can achieve the same thing like this:

const add = (x, y) => {
  return x + y;
}

export { add };
When you export a variable or function, you can import it in another file and use it without having to rewrite the code. You can export multiple things by repeating the first example for each thing you want to export, or by placing them all in the export statement of the second example, like this:

export { add, subtract };
There are two string-related functions in the editor. Export both of them using the method of your choice.
*/
const uppercaseString = (string) => {
  return string.toUpperCase();
}

const lowercaseString = (string) => {
  return string.toLowerCase()
}

export { uppercaseString, lowercaseString };
// ___________________________________________ 22 Reuse JavaScript Code Using import

/*
import allows you to choose which parts of a file or module to load. In the previous lesson, the examples exported add from the math_functions.js file. Here's how you can import it to use in another file:

import { add } from './math_functions.js';
Here, import will find add in math_functions.js, import just that function for you to use, and ignore the rest. The ./ tells the import to look for the math_functions.js file in the same folder as the current file. The relative file path (./) and file extension (.js) are required when using import in this way.

You can import more than one item from the file by adding them in the import statement like this:

import { add, subtract } from './math_functions.js';
Add the appropriate import statement that will allow the current file to use the uppercaseString and lowercaseString functions you exported in the previous lesson. These functions are in a file called string_functions.js, which is in the same directory as the current file.
*/
import { uppercaseString, lowercaseString } from './string_functions.js';
// Only change code above this line

uppercaseString("hello");
lowercaseString("WORLD!");
// ___________________________________________ 23 Use * to Import Everything from a File

/*
Suppose you have a file and you wish to import all of its contents into the current file. This can be done with the import * as syntax. Here's an example where the contents of a file named math_functions.js are imported into a file in the same directory:

import * as myMathModule from "./math_functions.js";
The above import statement will create an object called myMathModule. This is just a variable name, you can name it anything. The object will contain all of the exports from math_functions.js in it, so you can access the functions like you would any other object property. Here's how you can use the add and subtract functions that were imported:

myMathModule.add(2,3);
myMathModule.subtract(5,3);
The code in this file requires the contents of the file: string_functions.js, that is in the same directory as the current file. Use the import * as syntax to import everything from the file into an object called stringFunctions.
*/
import * as stringFunctions from "./string_functions.js";
// Only change code above this line

stringFunctions.uppercaseString("hello");
stringFunctions.lowercaseString("WORLD!");
// ___________________________________________ 24 Create an Export Fallback with export default

/*
In the export lesson, you learned about the syntax referred to as a named export. This allowed you to make multiple functions and variables available for use in other files.

There is another export syntax you need to know, known as export default. Usually you will use this syntax if only one value is being exported from a file. It is also used to create a fallback value for a file or module.

Below are examples using export default:

export default function add(x, y) {
  return x + y;
}

export default function(x, y) {
  return x + y;
}
The first is a named function, and the second is an anonymous function.

Since export default is used to declare a fallback value for a module or file, you can only have one value be a default export in each module or file. Additionally, you cannot use export default with var, let, or const

The following function should be the fallback value for the module. Please add the necessary code to do so.
*/
export default function subtract(x, y) {
  return x - y;
}
// ___________________________________________ 25 Import a Default Export

/*
In the last challenge, you learned about export default and its uses. To import a default export, you need to use a different import syntax. In the following example, add is the default export of the math_functions.js file. Here is how to import it:

import add from "./math_functions.js";
The syntax differs in one key place. The imported value, add, is not surrounded by curly braces ({}). add here is simply a variable name for whatever the default export of the math_functions.js file is. You can use any name here when importing a default.

In the following code, import the default export from the math_functions.js file, found in the same directory as this file. Give the import the name subtract.

import subtract from "./math_functions.js";

subtract(7,4);
// ___________________________________________ 26 Create a JavaScript Promise

/*
A promise in JavaScript is exactly what it sounds like - you use it to make a promise to do something, usually asynchronously. When the task completes, you either fulfill your promise or fail to do so. Promise is a constructor function, so you need to use the new keyword to create one. It takes a function, as its argument, with two parameters - resolve and reject. These are methods used to determine the outcome of the promise. The syntax looks like this:

const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {

});
Create a new promise called makeServerRequest. Pass in a function with resolve and reject parameters to the constructor.
*/
const makeServerRequest = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {

})

A promise has three states: pending, fulfilled, and rejected. The promise you created in the last challenge is forever stuck in the pending state because you did not add a way to complete the promise. The resolve and reject parameters given to the promise argument are used to do this. resolve is used when you want your promise to succeed, and reject is used when you want it to fail. These are methods that take an argument, as seen below.

const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  if(condition here) {
    resolve("Promise was fulfilled");
  } else {
    reject("Promise was rejected");
  }
});
The example above uses strings for the argument of these functions, but it can really be anything. Often, it might be an object, that you would use data from, to put on your website or elsewhere.

Make the promise handle success and failure. If responseFromServer is true, call the resolve method to successfully complete the promise. Pass resolve a string with the value We got the data. If responseFromServer is false, use the reject method instead and pass it the string: Data not received.
*/
const makeServerRequest = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  // responseFromServer represents a response from a server
  let responseFromServer;
    
  if(responseFromServer) {
    resolve("We got the data");
  } else {  
    reject("Data not received");
  }
});
// ___________________________________________ 28 Handle a Fulfilled Promise with then

/*
Promises are most useful when you have a process that takes an unknown amount of time in your code (i.e. something asynchronous), often a server request. When you make a server request it takes some amount of time, and after it completes you usually want to do something with the response from the server. This can be achieved by using the then method. The then method is executed immediately after your promise is fulfilled with resolve. Here’s an example:

myPromise.then(result => {
  
});
result comes from the argument given to the resolve method.

Add the then method to your promise. Use result as the parameter of its callback function and log result to the console.
*/
const makeServerRequest = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  // responseFromServer is set to true to represent a successful response from a server
  let responseFromServer = true;
    
  if(responseFromServer) {
    resolve("We got the data");
  } else {  
    reject("Data not received");
  }
});

makeServerRequest.then(result => console.log(result))
// ___________________________________________ 29 Handle a Rejected Promise with catch

/*
catch is the method used when your promise has been rejected. It is executed immediately after a promise's reject method is called. Here’s the syntax:

myPromise.catch(error => {
  
});
error is the argument passed in to the reject method.

Add the catch method to your promise. Use error as the parameter of its callback function and log error to the console.
*/
const makeServerRequest = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  // responseFromServer is set to false to represent an unsuccessful response from a server
  let responseFromServer = false;
    
  if(responseFromServer) {
    resolve("We got the data");
  } else {  
    reject("Data not received");
  }
});

makeServerRequest.then(result => {
  console.log(result);
});

makeServerRequest.catch(error => console.log(error))

// ___________________________________________Regular Expressions
// *******************************************

// ___________________________________________ 1 Using the Test Method

/*
Regular expressions are used in programming languages to match parts of strings. You create patterns to help you do that matching.

If you want to find the word the in the string The dog chased the cat, you could use the following regular expression: /the/. Notice that quote marks are not required within the regular expression.

JavaScript has multiple ways to use regexes. One way to test a regex is using the .test() method. The .test() method takes the regex, applies it to a string (which is placed inside the parentheses), and returns true or false if your pattern finds something or not.

let testStr = "freeCodeCamp";
let testRegex = /Code/;
testRegex.test(testStr);
The test method here returns true.

Apply the regex myRegex on the string myString using the .test() method.
*/
let myString = "Hello, World!";
let myRegex = /Hello/;
let result = myRegex.test(myString); // Change this line
// ___________________________________________ 2 Match Literal Strings

/*
In the last challenge, you searched for the word Hello using the regular expression /Hello/. That regex searched for a literal match of the string Hello. Here's another example searching for a literal match of the string Kevin:

let testStr = "Hello, my name is Kevin.";
let testRegex = /Kevin/;
testRegex.test(testStr);
This test call will return true.

Any other forms of Kevin will not match. For example, the regex /Kevin/ will not match kevin or KEVIN.

let wrongRegex = /kevin/;
wrongRegex.test(testStr);
This test call will return false.

A future challenge will show how to match those other forms as well.

Complete the regex waldoRegex to find "Waldo" in the string waldoIsHiding with a literal match.
*/
let waldoIsHiding = "Somewhere Waldo is hiding in this text.";
let waldoRegex = /Waldo/; // Change this line
let result = waldoRegex.test(waldoIsHiding);
// ___________________________________________ 3 Match a Literal String with Different Possibilities

/*
Using regexes like /coding/, you can look for the pattern coding in another string.

This is powerful to search single strings, but it's limited to only one pattern. You can search for multiple patterns using the alternation or OR operator: |.

This operator matches patterns either before or after it. For example, if you wanted to match the strings yes or no, the regex you want is /yes|no/.

You can also search for more than just two patterns. You can do this by adding more patterns with more OR operators separating them, like /yes|no|maybe/.

Complete the regex petRegex to match the pets dog, cat, bird, or fish.
*/
let petString = "James has a pet cat.";
let petRegex = /dog|cat|bird|fish/; // Change this line
let result = petRegex.test(petString);
// ___________________________________________ 4 Ignore Case While Matching

/*
Up until now, you've looked at regexes to do literal matches of strings. But sometimes, you might want to also match case differences.

Case (or sometimes letter case) is the difference between uppercase letters and lowercase letters. Examples of uppercase are A, B, and C. Examples of lowercase are a, b, and c.

You can match both cases using what is called a flag. There are other flags but here you'll focus on the flag that ignores case - the i flag. You can use it by appending it to the regex. An example of using this flag is /ignorecase/i. This regex can match the strings ignorecase, igNoreCase, and IgnoreCase.

Write a regex fccRegex to match freeCodeCamp, no matter its case. Your regex should not match any abbreviations or variations with spaces.
*/
let myString = "freeCodeCamp";
let fccRegex = /freeCodeCamp/i; // Change this line
let result = fccRegex.test(myString);
// ___________________________________________ 5 Extract Matches

/*
So far, you have only been checking if a pattern exists or not within a string. You can also extract the actual matches you found with the .match() method.

To use the .match() method, apply the method on a string and pass in the regex inside the parentheses.

Here's an example:

"Hello, World!".match(/Hello/);
let ourStr = "Regular expressions";
let ourRegex = /expressions/;
ourStr.match(ourRegex);
Here the first match would return ["Hello"] and the second would return ["expressions"].

Note that the .match syntax is the "opposite" of the .test method you have been using thus far:

'string'.match(/regex/);
/regex/.test('string');
Apply the .match() method to extract the string coding.
*/
let extractStr = "Extract the word 'coding' from this string.";
let codingRegex = /coding/; // Change this line
let result = extractStr.match(codingRegex); // Change this line
// ___________________________________________ 7 Find More Than the First Match

/*
So far, you have only been able to extract or search a pattern once.

let testStr = "Repeat, Repeat, Repeat";
let ourRegex = /Repeat/;
testStr.match(ourRegex);
Here match would return ["Repeat"].

To search or extract a pattern more than once, you can use the global search flag: g.

let repeatRegex = /Repeat/g;
testStr.match(repeatRegex);
And here match returns the value ["Repeat", "Repeat", "Repeat"]

Using the regex starRegex, find and extract both Twinkle words from the string twinkleStar.

Note
You can have multiple flags on your regex like /search/gi
*/
let twinkleStar = "Twinkle, twinkle, little star";
let starRegex = /twinkle/gi; // Change this line
let result = twinkleStar.match(starRegex); // Change this line
// ___________________________________________ 8 Match Anything with Wildcard Period

/*
Sometimes you won't (or don't need to) know the exact characters in your patterns. Thinking of all words that match, say, a misspelling would take a long time. Luckily, you can save time using the wildcard character: .

The wildcard character . will match any one character. The wildcard is also called dot and period. You can use the wildcard character just like any other character in the regex. For example, if you wanted to match hug, huh, hut, and hum, you can use the regex /hu./ to match all four words.

let humStr = "I'll hum a song";
let hugStr = "Bear hug";
let huRegex = /hu./;
huRegex.test(humStr);
huRegex.test(hugStr);
Both of these test calls would return true.

Complete the regex unRegex so that it matches the strings run, sun, fun, pun, nun, and bun. Your regex should use the wildcard character.
*/
let exampleStr = "Let's have fun with regular expressions!";
let unRegex = /.un/; // Change this line
let result = unRegex.test(exampleStr);
// ___________________________________________ 9 Match Single Character with Multiple Possibilities

/*
You learned how to match literal patterns (/literal/) and wildcard character (/./). Those are the extremes of regular expressions, where one finds exact matches and the other matches everything. There are options that are a balance between the two extremes.

You can search for a literal pattern with some flexibility with character classes. Character classes allow you to define a group of characters you wish to match by placing them inside square ([ and ]) brackets.

For example, you want to match bag, big, and bug but not bog. You can create the regex /b[aiu]g/ to do this. The [aiu] is the character class that will only match the characters a, i, or u.

let bigStr = "big";
let bagStr = "bag";
let bugStr = "bug";
let bogStr = "bog";
let bgRegex = /b[aiu]g/;
bigStr.match(bgRegex);
bagStr.match(bgRegex);
bugStr.match(bgRegex);
bogStr.match(bgRegex);
In order, the four match calls would return the values ["big"], ["bag"], ["bug"], and null.

Use a character class with vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in your regex vowelRegex to find all the vowels in the string quoteSample.

Note: Be sure to match both upper- and lowercase vowels.
*/
let quoteSample = "Beware of bugs in the above code; I have only proved it correct, not tried it.";
let vowelRegex = /[aeiou]/gi; // Change this line
let result = quoteSample.match(vowelRegex); // Change this line
// ___________________________________________ 10 Match Letters of the Alphabet

/*
You saw how you can use character sets to specify a group of characters to match, but that's a lot of typing when you need to match a large range of characters (for example, every letter in the alphabet). Fortunately, there is a built-in feature that makes this short and simple.

Inside a character set, you can define a range of characters to match using a hyphen character: -.

For example, to match lowercase letters a through e you would use [a-e].

let catStr = "cat";
let batStr = "bat";
let matStr = "mat";
let bgRegex = /[a-e]at/;
catStr.match(bgRegex);
batStr.match(bgRegex);
matStr.match(bgRegex);
In order, the three match calls would return the values ["cat"], ["bat"], and null.

Match all the letters in the string quoteSample.

Note: Be sure to match both uppercase and lowercase letters.
*/
let quoteSample = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.";
let alphabetRegex = /[a-z]/gi; // Change this line
let result = quoteSample.match(alphabetRegex); // Change this line
// ___________________________________________ 11 Match Numbers and Letters of the Alphabet

/*
Using the hyphen (-) to match a range of characters is not limited to letters. It also works to match a range of numbers.

For example, /[0-5]/ matches any number between 0 and 5, including the 0 and 5.

Also, it is possible to combine a range of letters and numbers in a single character set.

let jennyStr = "Jenny8675309";
let myRegex = /[a-z0-9]/ig;
jennyStr.match(myRegex);
Create a single regex that matches a range of letters between h and s, and a range of numbers between 2 and 6. Remember to include the appropriate flags in the regex.
*/
let quoteSample = "Blueberry 3.141592653s are delicious.";
let myRegex = /[h-s2-6]/ig; // Change this line
let result = quoteSample.match(myRegex); // Change this line
// ___________________________________________ 12 Match Single Characters Not Specified

/*
So far, you have created a set of characters that you want to match, but you could also create a set of characters that you do not want to match. These types of character sets are called negated character sets.

To create a negated character set, you place a caret character (^) after the opening bracket and before the characters you do not want to match.

For example, /[^aeiou]/gi matches all characters that are not a vowel. Note that characters like ., !, [, @, / and white space are matched - the negated vowel character set only excludes the vowel characters.

Create a single regex that matches all characters that are not a number or a vowel. Remember to include the appropriate flags in the regex.
*/
let quoteSample = "3 blind mice.";
let myRegex = /[^aeiou0-9]/gi; // Change this line
let result = quoteSample.match(myRegex); // Change this line
// ___________________________________________ 13 Match Characters that Occur One or More Times

/*
Sometimes, you need to match a character (or group of characters) that appears one or more times in a row. This means it occurs at least once, and may be repeated.

You can use the + character to check if that is the case. Remember, the character or pattern has to be present consecutively. That is, the character has to repeat one after the other.

For example, /a+/g would find one match in abc and return ["a"]. Because of the +, it would also find a single match in aabc and return ["aa"].

If it were instead checking the string abab, it would find two matches and return ["a", "a"] because the a characters are not in a row - there is a b between them. Finally, since there is no a in the string bcd, it wouldn't find a match.

You want to find matches when the letter s occurs one or more times in Mississippi. Write a regex that uses the + sign.
*/
let difficultSpelling = "Mississippi";
let myRegex = /s+/gi; // Change this line
let result = difficultSpelling.match(myRegex);
// ___________________________________________ 14 Match Characters that Occur Zero or More Times

/*
The last challenge used the plus + sign to look for characters that occur one or more times. There's also an option that matches characters that occur zero or more times.

The character to do this is the asterisk or star: *.

let soccerWord = "gooooooooal!";
let gPhrase = "gut feeling";
let oPhrase = "over the moon";
let goRegex = /go;
soccerWord.match(goRegex);
gPhrase.match(goRegex);
oPhrase.match(goRegex);
In order, the three match calls would return the values ["goooooooo"], ["g"], and null.

For this challenge, chewieQuote has been initialized as the string Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrgh! behind the scenes. Create a regex chewieRegex that uses the * character to match an uppercase A character immediately followed by zero or more lowercase a characters in chewieQuote. Your regex does not need flags or character classes, and it should not match any of the other quotes.
*/
// Only change code below this line
let chewieRegex = /Aa*/; // Change this line
// Only change code above this line

let result = chewieQuote.match(chewieRegex);
// ___________________________________________ 15 Find Characters with Lazy Matching

/*
In regular expressions, a greedy match finds the longest possible part of a string that fits the regex pattern and returns it as a match. The alternative is called a lazy match, which finds the smallest possible part of the string that satisfies the regex pattern.

You can apply the regex /t[a-z]*i/ to the string "titanic". This regex is basically a pattern that starts with t, ends with i, and has some letters in between.

Regular expressions are by default greedy, so the match would return ["titani"]. It finds the largest sub-string possible to fit the pattern.

However, you can use the ? character to change it to lazy matching. "titanic" matched against the adjusted regex of /t[a-z]*?i/ returns ["ti"].

Note: Parsing HTML with regular expressions should be avoided, but pattern matching an HTML string with regular expressions is completely fine.

Fix the regex /<.*>/ to return the HTML tag <h1> and not the text "<h1>Winter is coming</h1>". Remember the wildcard . in a regular expression matches any character.
*/
let text = "<h1>Winter is coming</h1>";
let myRegex = /<.1*?>/; // Change this line

// ___________________________________________ 16 Find One or More Criminals in a Hunt

/*
Time to pause and test your new regex writing skills. A group of criminals escaped from jail and ran away, but you don't know how many. However, you do know that they stay close together when they are around other people. You are responsible for finding all of the criminals at once.

Here's an example to review how to do this:

The regex /z+/ matches the letter z when it appears one or more times in a row. It would find matches in all of the following strings:

"z"
"zzzzzz"
"ABCzzzz"
"zzzzABC"
"abczzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzabc"
But it does not find matches in the following strings since there are no letter z characters:

""
"ABC"
"abcabc"
Write a greedy regex that finds one or more criminals within a group of other people. A criminal is represented by the capital letter C.

// ___________________________________________ 17 Match Beginning String Patterns

/*
Prior challenges showed that regular expressions can be used to look for a number of matches. They are also used to search for patterns in specific positions in strings.

In an earlier challenge, you used the caret character (^) inside a character set to create a negated character set in the form [^thingsThatWillNotBeMatched]. Outside of a character set, the caret is used to search for patterns at the beginning of strings.

let firstString = "Ricky is first and can be found.";
let firstRegex = /^Ricky/;
firstRegex.test(firstString);
let notFirst = "You can't find Ricky now.";
firstRegex.test(notFirst);
The first test call would return true, while the second would return false.

Use the caret character in a regex to find Cal only in the beginning of the string rickyAndCal.

let storyRegex = /story$/;
storyRegex.test(theEnding);
let noEnding = "Sometimes a story will have to end";

Using character classes, you were able to search for all letters of the alphabet with [a-z]. This kind of character class is common enough that there is a shortcut for it, although it includes a few extra characters as well.

The closest character class in JavaScript to match the alphabet is \w. This shortcut is equal to [A-Za-z0-9_]. This character class matches upper and lowercase letters plus numbers. Note, this character class also includes the underscore character (_).

/*
Recall that you use the plus sign + to look for one or more characters and the asterisk * to look for zero or more characters. These are convenient but sometimes you want to match a certain range of patterns.

// ___________________________________________ 30 Positive and Negative Lookahead

/*
Lookaheads are patterns that tell JavaScript to look-ahead in your string to check for patterns further along. This can be useful when you want to search for multiple patterns over the same string.

There are two kinds of lookaheads: positive lookahead and negative lookahead.

A positive lookahead will look to make sure the element in the search pattern is there, but won't actually match it. A positive lookahead is used as (?=...) where the ... is the required part that is not matched.

On the other hand, a negative lookahead will look to make sure the element in the search pattern is not there. A negative lookahead is used as (?!...) where the ... is the pattern that you do not want to be there. The rest of the pattern is returned if the negative lookahead part is not present.

Lookaheads are a bit confusing but some examples will help.

let quit = "qu";
let noquit = "qt";
let quRegex= /q(?=u)/;
let qRegex = /q(?!u)/;
quit.match(quRegex);
noquit.match(qRegex);
Both of these match calls would return ["q"].

A more practical use of lookaheads is to check two or more patterns in one string. Here is a (naively) simple password checker that looks for between 3 and 6 characters and at least one number:

let password = "abc123";
let checkPass = /(?=\w{3,6})(?=\D*\d)/;
checkPass.test(password);
Use lookaheads in the pwRegex to match passwords that are greater than 5 characters long, and have two consecutive digits.
*/
let sampleWord = "astronaut";
let pwRegex = /(?=\w{6})(?=.*\d{2})/; // Change this line
let result = pwRegex.test(sampleWord);
// ___________________________________________ 31 Check For Mixed Grouping of Characters

/*
Sometimes we want to check for groups of characters using a Regular Expression and to achieve that we use parentheses ().

If you want to find either Penguin or Pumpkin in a string, you can use the following Regular Expression: /P(engu|umpk)in/g

Then check whether the desired string groups are in the test string by using the test() method.

let testStr = "Pumpkin";
let testRegex = /P(engu|umpk)in/;
testRegex.test(testStr);
The test method here would return true.

Fix the regex so that it checks for the names of Franklin Roosevelt or Eleanor Roosevelt in a case sensitive manner and it should make concessions for middle names.

Then fix the code so that the regex that you have created is checked against myString and either true or false is returned depending on whether the regex matches.
*/
let myString = "Eleanor Roosevelt";
let myRegex = /(Franklin D.|Eleanor) Roosevelt/; // Change this line
let result = myRegex.test(myString); // Change this line
// After passing the challenge experiment with myString and see how the grouping works
// ___________________________________________ 32 Reuse Patterns Using Capture Groups

/*
Say you want to match a word that occurs multiple times like below.

let repeatStr = "row row row your boat";
You could use /row row row/, but what if you don't know the specific word repeated? Capture groups can be used to find repeated substrings.

Capture groups are constructed by enclosing the regex pattern to be captured in parentheses. In this case, the goal is to capture a word consisting of alphanumeric characters so the capture group will be \w+ enclosed by parentheses: /(\w+)/.

The substring matched by the group is saved to a temporary "variable", which can be accessed within the same regex using a backslash and the number of the capture group (e.g. \1). Capture groups are automatically numbered by the position of their opening parentheses (left to right), starting at 1.

The example below matches a word that occurs thrice separated by spaces:

let repeatRegex = /(\w+) \1 \1/;
repeatRegex.test(repeatStr); // Returns true
repeatStr.match(repeatRegex); // Returns ["row row row", "row"]
Using the .match() method on a string will return an array with the matched substring, along with its captured groups.

Use capture groups in reRegex to match a string that consists of only the same number repeated exactly three times separated by single spaces.
*/
let repeatNum = "42 42 42";
let reRegex = /^(\d+) \1 \1$/; // Change this line
let result = reRegex.test(repeatNum);
// ___________________________________________ 33 Use Capture Groups to Search and Replace

/*
Searching is useful. However, you can make searching even more powerful when it also changes (or replaces) the text you match.

You can search and replace text in a string using .replace() on a string. The inputs for .replace() is first the regex pattern you want to search for. The second parameter is the string to replace the match or a function to do something.

let wrongText = "The sky is silver.";
let silverRegex = /silver/;
wrongText.replace(silverRegex, "blue");
The replace call would return the string The sky is blue..

You can also access capture groups in the replacement string with dollar signs ($).

"Code Camp".replace(/(\w+)\s(\w+)/, '$2 $1');
The replace call would return the string Camp Code.

Write a regex fixRegex using three capture groups that will search for each word in the string one two three. Then update the replaceText variable to replace one two three with the string three two one and assign the result to the result variable. Make sure you are utilizing capture groups in the replacement string using the dollar sign ($) syntax.
*/
let str = "one two three";
let fixRegex = /(\w+)\s(\w+)\s(\w+)/; // Change this line
let replaceText = "$3 $2 $1"; // Change this line
let result = str.replace(fixRegex, replaceText);


// ________________________________________________________________________________ Debugging
// ********************************************************************************

// ___________________________________________ 1 Use the JavaScript Console to Check the Value of a Variable

/*
Both Chrome and Firefox have excellent JavaScript consoles, also known as DevTools, for debugging your JavaScript.

You can find Developer tools in your Chrome's menu or Web Console in Firefox's menu. If you're using a different browser, or a mobile phone, we strongly recommend switching to desktop Firefox or Chrome.

The console.log() method, which "prints" the output of what's within its parentheses to the console, will likely be the most helpful debugging tool. Placing it at strategic points in your code can show you the intermediate values of variables. It's good practice to have an idea of what the output should be before looking at what it is. Having check points to see the status of your calculations throughout your code will help narrow down where the problem is.

Here's an example to print the string Hello world! to the console:

console.log('Hello world!');
Use the console.log() method to print the value of the variable a where noted in the code.
*/
let a = 5;
let b = 1;
a++;
// Only change code below this line
console.log(a)

let sumAB = a + b;
console.log(sumAB);
// ___________________________________________ 2 Understanding the Differences between the freeCodeCamp and Browser Console

/*
You may have noticed that some freeCodeCamp challenges include their own console. This console behaves a little differently than the browser console.

There are many methods to use with console to output messages. log, warn, and clear to name a few. The freeCodeCamp console will only output log messages, while the browser console will output all messages. When you make changes to your code, it will automatically run and show the logs. The freeCodeCamp console is then cleared each time your code runs.

First, open your browser console so you can see the logs. To do that, you can right-click the freeCodeCamp navigation bar at the top and click inspect on most browsers. Then find the console tab in the window that opens.

After that, use console.log to log the output variable. View the two consoles to see the log. Finally, use console.clear after your log to clear the browser console. View the difference in the two consoles.
*/
let output = "Get this to show once in the freeCodeCamp console and not at all in the browser console";
console.log(output);
console.clear();
// ___________________________________________ 3 Use typeof to Check the Type of a Variable

/*
You can use typeof to check the data structure, or type, of a variable. This is useful in debugging when working with multiple data types. If you think you're adding two numbers, but one is actually a string, the results can be unexpected. Type errors can lurk in calculations or function calls. Be careful especially when you're accessing and working with external data in the form of a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) object.

Here are some examples using typeof:

console.log(typeof "");
console.log(typeof 0);
console.log(typeof []);
console.log(typeof {});
In order, the console will display the strings string, number, object, and object.

JavaScript recognizes seven primitive (immutable) data types: Boolean, Null, Undefined, Number, String, Symbol (new with ES6), and BigInt (new with ES2020), and one type for mutable items: Object. Note that in JavaScript, arrays are technically a type of object.

Add two console.log() statements to check the typeof each of the two variables seven and three in the code.
*/
let seven = 7;
let three = "3";
console.log(seven + three);
// Only change code below this line
console.log(typeof seven);
console.log(typeof three);
// ___________________________________________ 4 Catch Misspelled Variable and Function Names

/*
The console.log() and typeof methods are the two primary ways to check intermediate values and types of program output. Now it's time to get into the common forms that bugs take. One syntax-level issue that fast typers can commiserate with is the humble spelling error.

Transposed, missing, or mis-capitalized characters in a variable or function name will have the browser looking for an object that doesn't exist - and complain in the form of a reference error. JavaScript variable and function names are case-sensitive.

Fix the two spelling errors in the code so the netWorkingCapital calculation works.
*/

let receivables = 10;
let payables = 8;
let netWorkingCapital = receivables - payables;
console.log(`Net working capital is: ${netWorkingCapital}`);

// ___________________________________________ 5 Catch Unclosed Parentheses, Brackets, Braces and Quotes

/*
Another syntax error to be aware of is that all opening parentheses, brackets, curly braces, and quotes have a closing pair. Forgetting a piece tends to happen when you're editing existing code and inserting items with one of the pair types. Also, take care when nesting code blocks into others, such as adding a callback function as an argument to a method.

One way to avoid this mistake is as soon as the opening character is typed, immediately include the closing match, then move the cursor back between them and continue coding. Fortunately, most modern code editors generate the second half of the pair automatically.

Fix the two pair errors in the code.
 */
let myArray = [1, 2, 3];
let arraySum = myArray.reduce((previous, current) =>  previous + current);
console.log(`Sum of array values is: ${arraySum}`);
// ___________________________________________ 6 Catch Mixed Usage of Single and Double Quotes

/*
JavaScript allows the use of both single (') and double (") quotes to declare a string. Deciding which one to use generally comes down to personal preference, with some exceptions.

Having two choices is great when a string has contractions or another piece of text that's in quotes. Just be careful that you don't close the string too early, which causes a syntax error.

Here are some examples of mixing quotes:

const grouchoContraction = "I've had a perfectly wonderful evening, but this wasn't it.";
const quoteInString = "Groucho Marx once said 'Quote me as saying I was mis-quoted.'";
const uhOhGroucho = 'I've had a perfectly wonderful evening, but this wasn't it.';
The first two are correct, but the third is incorrect.

Of course, it is okay to use only one style of quotes. You can escape the quotes inside the string by using the backslash (\) escape character:

const allSameQuotes = 'I\'ve had a perfectly wonderful evening, but this wasn\'t it.';
Fix the string so it either uses different quotes for the href value, or escape the existing ones. Keep the double quote marks around the entire string.
*/
let innerHtml = "<p>Click here to <a href=\"#Home\">return home</a></p>";
console.log(innerHtml);
// ___________________________________________ 7 Catch Use of Assignment Operator Instead of Equality Operator

/*
Branching programs, i.e. ones that do different things if certain conditions are met, rely on if, else if, and else statements in JavaScript. The condition sometimes takes the form of testing whether a result is equal to a value.

This logic is spoken (in English, at least) as "if x equals y, then ..." which can literally translate into code using the =, or assignment operator. This leads to unexpected control flow in your program.

As covered in previous challenges, the assignment operator (=) in JavaScript assigns a value to a variable name. And the == and === operators check for equality (the triple === tests for strict equality, meaning both value and type are the same).

The code below assigns x to be 2, which evaluates as true. Almost every value on its own in JavaScript evaluates to true, except what are known as the "falsy" values: false, 0, "" (an empty string), NaN, undefined, and null.

let x = 1;
let y = 2;
if (x = y) {

} else {

}
In this example, the code block within the if statement will run for any value of y, unless y is falsy. The else block, which we expect to run here, will not actually run.

Fix the condition so the program runs the right branch, and the appropriate value is assigned to result.
*/
let x = 7;
let y = 9;
let result = "to come";

if(x === y) {
  result = "Equal!";
} else {
  result = "Not equal!";
}

console.log(result);
// ___________________________________________ 8 Catch Missing Open and Closing Parenthesis After a Function Call

/*
When a function or method doesn't take any arguments, you may forget to include the (empty) opening and closing parentheses when calling it. Often times the result of a function call is saved in a variable for other use in your code. This error can be detected by logging variable values (or their types) to the console and seeing that one is set to a function reference, instead of the expected value the function returns.

The variables in the following example are different:

function myFunction() {
  return "You rock!";
}
let varOne = myFunction;
let varTwo = myFunction();
Here varOne is the function myFunction, and varTwo is the string You rock!.

Fix the code so the variable result is set to the value returned from calling the function getNine.
*/
function getNine() {
  let x = 6;
  let y = 3;
  return x + y;
}

let result = getNine();
console.log(result);
// ___________________________________________ 9 Catch Arguments Passed in the Wrong Order When Calling a Function


/*
Continuing the discussion on calling functions, the next bug to watch out for is when a function's arguments are supplied in the incorrect order. If the arguments are different types, such as a function expecting an array and an integer, this will likely throw a runtime error. If the arguments are the same type (all integers, for example), then the logic of the code won't make sense. Make sure to supply all required arguments, in the proper order to avoid these issues.

The function raiseToPower raises a base to an exponent. Unfortunately, it's not called properly - fix the code so the value of power is the expected 8.
*/
function raiseToPower(b, e) {
  return Math.pow(b, e);
}

let base = 2;
let exp = 3;
let power = raiseToPower(base, exp);
console.log(power);
// ___________________________________________ 10 Catch Off By One Errors When Using Indexing

/*
Off by one errors (sometimes called OBOE) crop up when you're trying to target a specific index of a string or array (to slice or access a segment), or when looping over the indices of them. JavaScript indexing starts at zero, not one, which means the last index is always one less than the length of the item. If you try to access an index equal to the length, the program may throw an "index out of range" reference error or print undefined.

When you use string or array methods that take index ranges as arguments, it helps to read the documentation and understand if they are inclusive (the item at the given index is part of what's returned) or not. Here are some examples of off by one errors:

let alphabet = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz";
let len = alphabet.length;
for (let i = 0; i <= len; i++) {
  console.log(alphabet[i]);
}
for (let j = 1; j < len; j++) {
  console.log(alphabet[j]);
}
for (let k = 0; k < len; k++) {
  console.log(alphabet[k]);
}
The first example here loops one too many times, and the second loops one too few times (missing the first index, 0). The third example is correct.

Fix the two indexing errors in the following function so all the numbers 1 through 5 are printed to the console.
*/
function countToFive() {
  let firstFive = "12345";
  let len = firstFive.length;
  // Only change code below this line
  for (let i = 0; i < len; i++) {
  // Only change code above this line
    console.log(firstFive[i]);
  }
}

countToFive();
// ___________________________________________ 11 Use Caution When Reinitializing Variables Inside a Loop

/*
Sometimes it's necessary to save information, increment counters, or re-set variables within a loop. A potential issue is when variables either should be reinitialized, and aren't, or vice versa. This is particularly dangerous if you accidentally reset the variable being used for the terminal condition, causing an infinite loop.

Printing variable values with each cycle of your loop by using console.log() can uncover buggy behavior related to resetting, or failing to reset a variable.

The following function is supposed to create a two-dimensional array with m rows and n columns of zeroes. Unfortunately, it's not producing the expected output because the row variable isn't being reinitialized (set back to an empty array) in the outer loop. Fix the code so it returns a correct 3x2 array of zeroes, which looks like [[0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0]].
*/
function zeroArray(m, n) {
  // Creates a 2-D array with m rows and n columns of zeroes
  let newArray = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    // Adds the m-th row into newArray
    let row = []
    for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      // Pushes n zeroes into the current row to create the columns
      row.push(0);
    }
    // Pushes the current row, which now has n zeroes in it, to the array
    newArray.push(row);
  }
  return newArray;
}

let matrix = zeroArray(3, 2);
console.log(matrix);

// ___________________________________________ 12 Prevent Infinite Loops with a Valid Terminal Condition

/*
The final topic is the dreaded infinite loop. Loops are great tools when you need your program to run a code block a certain number of times or until a condition is met, but they need a terminal condition that ends the looping. Infinite loops are likely to freeze or crash the browser, and cause general program execution mayhem, which no one wants.

There was an example of an infinite loop in the introduction to this section - it had no terminal condition to break out of the while loop inside loopy(). Do NOT call this function!

function loopy() {
  while(true) {
    console.log("Hello, world!");
  }
}
It's the programmer's job to ensure that the terminal condition, which tells the program when to break out of the loop code, is eventually reached. One error is incrementing or decrementing a counter variable in the wrong direction from the terminal condition. Another one is accidentally resetting a counter or index variable within the loop code, instead of incrementing or decrementing it.

The myFunc() function contains an infinite loop because the terminal condition i != 4 will never evaluate to false (and break the looping) - i will increment by 2 each pass, and jump right over 4 since i is odd to start. Fix the comparison operator in the terminal condition so the loop only runs for i less than or equal to 4.
*/
function myFunc() {
  for (let i = 1; i <= 4; i += 2) {
    console.log("Still going!");
  }
}
// ___________________________________________ Basic Data Structures
// *******************************************

// ___________________________________________ 1 Use an Array to Store a Collection of Data

/*
The below is an example of the simplest implementation of an array data structure. This is known as a one-dimensional array, meaning it only has one level, or that it does not have any other arrays nested within it. Notice it contains booleans, strings, and numbers, among other valid JavaScript data types:

let simpleArray = ['one', 2, 'three', true, false, undefined, null];
console.log(simpleArray.length);
The console.log call displays 7.

All arrays have a length property, which as shown above, can be very easily accessed with the syntax Array.length. A more complex implementation of an array can be seen below. This is known as a multi-dimensional array, or an array that contains other arrays. Notice that this array also contains JavaScript objects, which we will examine very closely in our next section, but for now, all you need to know is that arrays are also capable of storing complex objects.

let complexArray = [
  [
    {
      one: 1,
      two: 2
    },
    {
      three: 3,
      four: 4
    }
  ],
  [
    {
      a: "a",
      b: "b"
    },
    {
      c: "c",
      d: "d"
    }
  ]
];
We have defined a variable called yourArray. Complete the statement by assigning an array of at least 5 elements in length to the yourArray variable. Your array should contain at least one string, one number, and one boolean.
*/
let yourArray = ['one', 2, 'three', true, false, undefined, null]; // Change this line
// ___________________________________________ 2 Access an Array's Contents Using Bracket Notation

/*
The fundamental feature of any data structure is, of course, the ability to not only store data, but to be able to retrieve that data on command. So, now that we've learned how to create an array, let's begin to think about how we can access that array's information.

When we define a simple array as seen below, there are 3 items in it:

let ourArray = ["a", "b", "c"];
In an array, each array item has an index. This index doubles as the position of that item in the array, and how you reference it. However, it is important to note, that JavaScript arrays are zero-indexed, meaning that the first element of an array is actually at the zeroth position, not the first. In order to retrieve an element from an array we can enclose an index in brackets and append it to the end of an array, or more commonly, to a variable which references an array object. This is known as bracket notation. For example, if we want to retrieve the a from ourArray and assign it to a variable, we can do so with the following code:

let ourVariable = ourArray[0];
Now ourVariable has the value of a.

In addition to accessing the value associated with an index, you can also set an index to a value using the same notation:

ourArray[1] = "not b anymore";
Using bracket notation, we have now reset the item at index 1 from the string b, to not b anymore. Now ourArray is ["a", "not b anymore", "c"].

In order to complete this challenge, set the 2nd position (index 1) of myArray to anything you want, besides the letter b.
*/
let myArray = ["a", "b", "c", "d"];
// Only change code below this line
myArray[1] = 'e'
// Only change code above this line
console.log(myArray);
// ___________________________________________ 3 Add Items to an Array with push() and unshift()

/*
An array's length, like the data types it can contain, is not fixed. Arrays can be defined with a length of any number of elements, and elements can be added or removed over time; in other words, arrays are mutable. In this challenge, we will look at two methods with which we can programmatically modify an array: Array.push() and Array.unshift().

Both methods take one or more elements as parameters and add those elements to the array the method is being called on; the push() method adds elements to the end of an array, and unshift() adds elements to the beginning. Consider the following:

let twentyThree = 'XXIII';
let romanNumerals = ['XXI', 'XXII'];

romanNumerals.unshift('XIX', 'XX');
romanNumerals would have the value ['XIX', 'XX', 'XXI', 'XXII'].

romanNumerals.push(twentyThree);
romanNumerals would have the value ['XIX', 'XX', 'XXI', 'XXII', 'XXIII']. Notice that we can also pass variables, which allows us even greater flexibility in dynamically modifying our array's data.

We have defined a function, mixedNumbers, which we are passing an array as an argument. Modify the function by using push() and unshift() to add 'I', 2, 'three' to the beginning of the array and 7, 'VIII', 9 to the end so that the returned array contains representations of the numbers 1-9 in order.
*/
function mixedNumbers(arr) {
  // Only change code below this line
  arr.unshift('I', 2, 'three')
  arr.push(7, 'VIII', 9)
  // Only change code above this line
  return arr;
}

console.log(mixedNumbers(['IV', 5, 'six']));
// ___________________________________________ 4 Remove Items from an Array with pop() and shift()

/*
Both push() and unshift() have corresponding methods that are nearly functional opposites: pop() and shift(). As you may have guessed by now, instead of adding, pop() removes an element from the end of an array, while shift() removes an element from the beginning. The key difference between pop() and shift() and their cousins push() and unshift(), is that neither method takes parameters, and each only allows an array to be modified by a single element at a time.

Let's take a look:

let greetings = ['whats up?', 'hello', 'see ya!'];

greetings.pop();
greetings would have the value ['whats up?', 'hello'].

greetings.shift();
greetings would have the value ['hello'].

We can also return the value of the removed element with either method like this:

let popped = greetings.pop();
greetings would have the value [], and popped would have the value hello.

We have defined a function, popShift, which takes an array as an argument and returns a new array. Modify the function, using pop() and shift(), to remove the first and last elements of the argument array, and assign the removed elements to their corresponding variables, so that the returned array contains their values.
*/
function popShift(arr) {
  let popped = arr.pop(); // Change this line
  let shifted = arr.shift(); // Change this line
  return [shifted, popped];
}

console.log(popShift(['challenge', 'is', 'not', 'complete']));
// ___________________________________________ 5 Remove Items Using splice()

/*
Ok, so we've learned how to remove elements from the beginning and end of arrays using shift() and pop(), but what if we want to remove an element from somewhere in the middle? Or remove more than one element at once? Well, that's where splice() comes in. splice() allows us to do just that: remove any number of consecutive elements from anywhere in an array.

splice() can take up to 3 parameters, but for now, we'll focus on just the first 2. The first two parameters of splice() are integers which represent indexes, or positions, of items in the array that splice() is being called upon. And remember, arrays are zero-indexed, so to indicate the first element of an array, we would use 0. splice()'s first parameter represents the index on the array from which to begin removing elements, while the second parameter indicates the number of elements to delete. For example:

let array = ['today', 'was', 'not', 'so', 'great'];

array.splice(2, 2);
Here we remove 2 elements, beginning with the third element (at index 2). array would have the value ['today', 'was', 'great'].

splice() not only modifies the array it's being called on, but it also returns a new array containing the value of the removed elements:

let array = ['I', 'am', 'feeling', 'really', 'happy'];

let newArray = array.splice(3, 2);
newArray has the value ['really', 'happy'].

We've initialized an array arr. Use splice() to remove elements from arr, so that it only contains elements that sum to the value of 10.
*/
const arr = [2, 4, 5, 1, 7, 5, 2, 1];
// Only change code below this line
arr.splice(1,4)
// Only change code above this line
console.log(arr);
// ___________________________________________ 6 Add Items Using splice()

/*
Remember in the last challenge we mentioned that splice() can take up to three parameters? Well, you can use the third parameter, comprised of one or more element(s), to add to the array. This can be incredibly useful for quickly switching out an element, or a set of elements, for another.

const numbers = [10, 11, 12, 12, 15];
const startIndex = 3;
const amountToDelete = 1;

numbers.splice(startIndex, amountToDelete, 13, 14);
console.log(numbers);
The second occurrence of 12 is removed, and we add 13 and 14 at the same index. The numbers array would now be [ 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 ].

Here, we begin with an array of numbers. Then, we pass the following to splice(): The index at which to begin deleting elements (3), the number of elements to be deleted (1), and the remaining arguments (13, 14) will be inserted starting at that same index. Note that there can be any number of elements (separated by commas) following amountToDelete, each of which gets inserted.

We have defined a function, htmlColorNames, which takes an array of HTML colors as an argument. Modify the function using splice() to remove the first two elements of the array and add 'DarkSalmon' and 'BlanchedAlmond' in their respective places.
*/
function htmlColorNames(arr) {
  // Only change code below this line
  arr.splice(0,2,'DarkSalmon', 'BlanchedAlmond')
  // Only change code above this line
  return arr;
}

console.log(htmlColorNames(['DarkGoldenRod', 'WhiteSmoke', 'LavenderBlush', 'PaleTurquoise', 'FireBrick']));
// ___________________________________________ 7 Copy Array Items Using slice()

/*
The next method we will cover is slice(). Rather than modifying an array, slice() copies or extracts a given number of elements to a new array, leaving the array it is called upon untouched. slice() takes only 2 parameters — the first is the index at which to begin extraction, and the second is the index at which to stop extraction (extraction will occur up to, but not including the element at this index). Consider this:

let weatherConditions = ['rain', 'snow', 'sleet', 'hail', 'clear'];

let todaysWeather = weatherConditions.slice(1, 3);
todaysWeather would have the value ['snow', 'sleet'], while weatherConditions would still have ['rain', 'snow', 'sleet', 'hail', 'clear'].

In effect, we have created a new array by extracting elements from an existing array.

We have defined a function, forecast, that takes an array as an argument. Modify the function using slice() to extract information from the argument array and return a new array that contains the string elements warm and sunny.
*/
function forecast(arr) {
  // Only change code below this line

  return arr.slice(2,4);
}

console.log(forecast(['cold', 'rainy', 'warm', 'sunny', 'cool', 'thunderstorms']));
// ___________________________________________ 8 Copy an Array with the Spread Operator

/*
While slice() allows us to be selective about what elements of an array to copy, among several other useful tasks, ES6's new spread operator allows us to easily copy all of an array's elements, in order, with a simple and highly readable syntax. The spread syntax simply looks like this: ...

In practice, we can use the spread operator to copy an array like so:

let thisArray = [true, true, undefined, false, null];
let thatArray = [...thisArray];
thatArray equals [true, true, undefined, false, null]. thisArray remains unchanged and thatArray contains the same elements as thisArray.

We have defined a function, copyMachine which takes arr (an array) and num (a number) as arguments. The function is supposed to return a new array made up of num copies of arr. We have done most of the work for you, but it doesn't work quite right yet. Modify the function using spread syntax so that it works correctly (hint: another method we have already covered might come in handy here!).
*/
function copyMachine(arr, num) {
  let newArr = [];
  while (num >= 1) {
    // Only change code below this line
    newArr.push([...arr])
    // Only change code above this line
    num--;
  }
  return newArr;
}

console.log(copyMachine([true, false, true], 2));
// ___________________________________________ 9 Combine Arrays with the Spread Operator

/*
Another huge advantage of the spread operator is the ability to combine arrays, or to insert all the elements of one array into another, at any index. With more traditional syntaxes, we can concatenate arrays, but this only allows us to combine arrays at the end of one, and at the start of another. Spread syntax makes the following operation extremely simple:

let thisArray = ['sage', 'rosemary', 'parsley', 'thyme'];

let thatArray = ['basil', 'cilantro', ...thisArray, 'coriander'];
thatArray would have the value ['basil', 'cilantro', 'sage', 'rosemary', 'parsley', 'thyme', 'coriander'].

Using spread syntax, we have just achieved an operation that would have been more complex and more verbose had we used traditional methods.

We have defined a function spreadOut that returns the variable sentence. Modify the function using the spread operator so that it returns the array ['learning', 'to', 'code', 'is', 'fun'].

*/
function spreadOut() {
  let fragment = ['to', 'code'];
  let sentence = ['learning', ...fragment, 'is', 'fun']; // Change this line
  return sentence;
}

console.log(spreadOut());
// ___________________________________________ 10 Check For The Presence of an Element With indexOf()

/*
Since arrays can be changed, or mutated, at any time, there's no guarantee about where a particular piece of data will be on a given array, or if that element even still exists. Luckily, JavaScript provides us with another built-in method, indexOf(), that allows us to quickly and easily check for the presence of an element on an array. indexOf() takes an element as a parameter, and when called, it returns the position, or index, of that element, or -1 if the element does not exist on the array.

For example:

let fruits = ['apples', 'pears', 'oranges', 'peaches', 'pears'];

fruits.indexOf('dates');
fruits.indexOf('oranges');
fruits.indexOf('pears');
indexOf('dates') returns -1, indexOf('oranges') returns 2, and indexOf('pears') returns 1 (the first index at which each element exists).

indexOf() can be incredibly useful for quickly checking for the presence of an element on an array. We have defined a function, quickCheck, that takes an array and an element as arguments. Modify the function using indexOf() so that it returns true if the passed element exists on the array, and false if it does not.
*/
function quickCheck(arr, elem) {
  // Only change code below this line
  if (arr.indexOf(elem) !== -1) {
    return true;
  } else {
    return false
  }
  // Only change code above this line
}

console.log(quickCheck(['squash', 'onions', 'shallots'], 'mushrooms'));
// ___________________________________________ 11 Iterate Through All an Array's Items Using For Loops

/*
Sometimes when working with arrays, it is very handy to be able to iterate through each item to find one or more elements that we might need, or to manipulate an array based on which data items meet a certain set of criteria. JavaScript offers several built in methods that each iterate over arrays in slightly different ways to achieve different results (such as every(), forEach(), map(), etc.), however the technique which is most flexible and offers us the greatest amount of control is a simple for loop.

Consider the following:

function greaterThanTen(arr) {
  let newArr = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if (arr[i] > 10) {
      newArr.push(arr[i]);
    }
  }
  return newArr;
}

greaterThanTen([2, 12, 8, 14, 80, 0, 1]);
Using a for loop, this function iterates through and accesses each element of the array, and subjects it to a simple test that we have created. In this way, we have easily and programmatically determined which data items are greater than 10, and returned a new array, [12, 14, 80], containing those items.

We have defined a function, filteredArray, which takes arr, a nested array, and elem as arguments, and returns a new array. elem represents an element that may or may not be present on one or more of the arrays nested within arr. Modify the function, using a for loop, to return a filtered version of the passed array such that any array nested within arr containing elem has been removed.
*/
function filteredArray(arr, elem) {
  let newArr = [];
  // Only change code below this line
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if (arr[i].indexOf(elem) === -1) {
      newArr.push(arr[i])
    }
  }
  // Only change code above this line
  return newArr;
}

console.log(filteredArray([[3, 2, 3], [1, 6, 3], [3, 13, 26], [19, 3, 9]], 3));
// ___________________________________________ 12 Create complex multi-dimensional arrays

/*
Awesome! You have just learned a ton about arrays! This has been a fairly high level overview, and there is plenty more to learn about working with arrays, much of which you will see in later sections. But before moving on to looking at Objects, let's take one more look, and see how arrays can become a bit more complex than what we have seen in previous challenges.

One of the most powerful features when thinking of arrays as data structures, is that arrays can contain, or even be completely made up of other arrays. We have seen arrays that contain arrays in previous challenges, but fairly simple ones. However, arrays can contain an infinite depth of arrays that can contain other arrays, each with their own arbitrary levels of depth, and so on. In this way, an array can very quickly become a very complex data structure, known as a multi-dimensional, or nested array. Consider the following example:

let nestedArray = [
  ['deep'],
  [
    ['deeper'], ['deeper'] 
  ],
  [
    [
      ['deepest'], ['deepest']
    ],
    [
      [
        ['deepest-est?']
      ]
    ]
  ]
];
The deep array is nested 2 levels deep. The deeper arrays are 3 levels deep. The deepest arrays are 4 levels, and the deepest-est? is 5.

While this example may seem convoluted, this level of complexity is not unheard of, or even unusual, when dealing with large amounts of data. However, we can still very easily access the deepest levels of an array this complex with bracket notation:

console.log(nestedArray[2][1][0][0][0]);
This logs the string deepest-est?. And now that we know where that piece of data is, we can reset it if we need to:

nestedArray[2][1][0][0][0] = 'deeper still';

console.log(nestedArray[2][1][0][0][0]);
Now it logs deeper still.

We have defined a variable, myNestedArray, set equal to an array. Modify myNestedArray, using any combination of strings, numbers, and booleans for data elements, so that it has exactly five levels of depth (remember, the outer-most array is level 1). Somewhere on the third level, include the string deep, on the fourth level, include the string deeper, and on the fifth level, include the string deepest.
*/

let myNestedArray = [
  // Only change code below this line
  [
    'unshift', false, 1, 2, 3, 'complex', 'nested', 
    [
      'deep', 
      [
        'deeper', 
        [
          'deepest', 
        ]
      ]
    ]
  ],
  // Only change code above this line
];
// ___________________________________________ 13 Add Key-Value Pairs to JavaScript Objects

/*
At their most basic, objects are just collections of key-value pairs. In other words, they are pieces of data (values) mapped to unique identifiers called properties (keys). Take a look at an example:

const tekkenCharacter = {
  player: 'Hwoarang',
  fightingStyle: 'Tae Kwon Doe',
  human: true
};
The above code defines a Tekken video game character object called tekkenCharacter. It has three properties, each of which map to a specific value. If you want to add an additional property, such as "origin", it can be done by assigning origin to the object:

tekkenCharacter.origin = 'South Korea';
This uses dot notation. If you were to observe the tekkenCharacter object, it will now include the origin property. Hwoarang also had distinct orange hair. You can add this property with bracket notation by doing:

tekkenCharacter['hair color'] = 'dyed orange';
Bracket notation is required if your property has a space in it or if you want to use a variable to name the property. In the above case, the property is enclosed in quotes to denote it as a string and will be added exactly as shown. Without quotes, it will be evaluated as a variable and the name of the property will be whatever value the variable is. Here's an example with a variable:

const eyes = 'eye color';

tekkenCharacter[eyes] = 'brown';
After adding all the examples, the object will look like this:

{
  player: 'Hwoarang',
  fightingStyle: 'Tae Kwon Doe',
  human: true,
  origin: 'South Korea',
  'hair color': 'dyed orange',
  'eye color': 'brown'
};
A foods object has been created with three entries. Using the syntax of your choice, add three more entries to it: bananas with a value of 13, grapes with a value of 35, and strawberries with a value of 27.
*/
let foods = {
  apples: 25,
  oranges: 32,
  plums: 28
};

// Only change code below this line
foods['bananas'] = 13; 
foods['grapes'] = 35; 
foods['strawberries'] = 27; 
// Only change code above this line

console.log(foods);

// ___________________________________________ 14 Modify an Object Nested Within an Object

/*
Now let's take a look at a slightly more complex object. Object properties can be nested to an arbitrary depth, and their values can be any type of data supported by JavaScript, including arrays and even other objects. Consider the following:

let nestedObject = {
  id: 28802695164,
  date: 'December 31, 2016',
  data: {
    totalUsers: 99,
    online: 80,
    onlineStatus: {
      active: 67,
      away: 13,
      busy: 8
    }
  }
};
nestedObject has three properties: id (value is a number), date (value is a string), and data (value is an object with its nested structure). While structures can quickly become complex, we can still use the same notations to access the information we need. To assign the value 10 to the busy property of the nested onlineStatus object, we use dot notation to reference the property:

nestedObject.data.onlineStatus.busy = 10;
Here we've defined an object userActivity, which includes another object nested within it. Set the value of the online key to 45.
*/
let userActivity = {
  id: 23894201352,
  date: 'January 1, 2017',
  data: {
    totalUsers: 51,
    online: 42
  }
};

// Only change code below this line
userActivity.data.online = 45
// Only change code above this line

console.log(userActivity);
// ___________________________________________ 15 Access Property Names with Bracket Notation

/*
In the first object challenge we mentioned the use of bracket notation as a way to access property values using the evaluation of a variable. For instance, imagine that our foods object is being used in a program for a supermarket cash register. We have some function that sets the selectedFood and we want to check our foods object for the presence of that food. This might look like:

let selectedFood = getCurrentFood(scannedItem);
let inventory = foods[selectedFood];
This code will evaluate the value stored in the selectedFood variable and return the value of that key in the foods object, or undefined if it is not present. Bracket notation is very useful because sometimes object properties are not known before runtime or we need to access them in a more dynamic way.

We've defined a function, checkInventory, which receives a scanned item as an argument. Return the current value of the scannedItem key in the foods object. You can assume that only valid keys will be provided as an argument to checkInventory.
*/
let foods = {
  apples: 25,
  oranges: 32,
  plums: 28,
  bananas: 13,
  grapes: 35,
  strawberries: 27
};

function checkInventory(scannedItem) {
  // Only change code below this line
  return foods[scannedItem]
  // Only change code above this line
}

console.log(checkInventory("apples"));
// ___________________________________________ 16 Use the delete Keyword to Remove Object Properties

/*
Now you know what objects are and their basic features and advantages. In short, they are key-value stores which provide a flexible, intuitive way to structure data, and, they provide very fast lookup time. Throughout the rest of these challenges, we will describe several common operations you can perform on objects so you can become comfortable applying these useful data structures in your programs.

In earlier challenges, we have both added to and modified an object's key-value pairs. Here we will see how we can remove a key-value pair from an object.

Let's revisit our foods object example one last time. If we wanted to remove the apples key, we can remove it by using the delete keyword like this:

delete foods.apples;
Use the delete keyword to remove the oranges, plums, and strawberries keys from the foods object.
*/
let foods = {
  apples: 25,
  oranges: 32,
  plums: 28,
  bananas: 13,
  grapes: 35,
  strawberries: 27
};

// Only change code below this line
delete foods.oranges;
delete foods.plums;
delete foods.strawberries ;
// Only change code above this line

console.log(foods);
// ___________________________________________ 17 Check if an Object has a Property

/*
Now we can add, modify, and remove keys from objects. But what if we just wanted to know if an object has a specific property? JavaScript provides us with two different ways to do this. One uses the hasOwnProperty() method and the other uses the in keyword. If we have an object users with a property of Alan, we could check for its presence in either of the following ways:

users.hasOwnProperty('Alan');
'Alan' in users;
Both of these would return true.

Finish writing the function so that it returns true if the object passed to it contains all four names, Alan, Jeff, Sarah and Ryan and returns false otherwise.
*/
let users = {
  Alan: {
    age: 27,
    online: true
  },
  Jeff: {
    age: 32,
    online: true
  },
  Sarah: {
    age: 48,
    online: true
  },
  Ryan: {
    age: 19,
    online: true
  }
};

function isEveryoneHere(userObj) {
  // Only change code below this line
  return 'Alan' in userObj && 'Jeff' in userObj && 'Sarah' in userObj && 'Ryan' in userObj 
  // Only change code above this line
}

console.log(isEveryoneHere(users));
// ___________________________________________ 18 Iterate Through the Keys of an Object with a for...in Statement

/*
Sometimes you need to iterate through all the keys within an object. You can use a for...in loop to do this. The for...in loop looks like:

const refrigerator = {
  'milk': 1,
  'eggs': 12,
};

for (const food in refrigerator) {
  console.log(food, refrigerator[food]);
}
This code logs milk 1 and eggs 12, with each key-value pair on its own line.

We defined the variable food in the loop head and this variable was set to each of the object's keys on each iteration, resulting in each food's name being printed to the console.

NOTE: Objects do not maintain an ordering to stored keys like arrays do; thus a key's position on an object, or the relative order in which it appears, is irrelevant when referencing or accessing that key.

We've defined a function countOnline which accepts one argument, allUsers. Use a for...in statement inside this function to loop through the allUsers object and return the number of users whose online property is set to true. An example of an object which could be passed to countOnline is shown below. Each user will have an online property set to either true or false.

{
  Alan: {
    online: false
  },
  Jeff: {
    online: true
  },
  Sarah: {
    online: false
  }
}
*/
const users = {
  Alan: {
    online: false
  },
  Jeff: {
    online: true
  },
  Sarah: {
    online: false
  }
}

function countOnline(allUsers) {
  // Only change code below this line
  let count = 0;
  for (const user in allUsers) {
    if (allUsers[user].online) count++;
  }
  return count;
  // Only change code above this line
}

console.log(countOnline(users));
// ___________________________________________ 19 Generate an Array of All Object Keys with Object.keys()

/*
We can also generate an array which contains all the keys stored in an object with the Object.keys() method. This method takes an object as the argument and returns an array of strings representing each property in the object. Again, there will be no specific order to the entries in the array.

Finish writing the getArrayOfUsers function so that it returns an array containing all the properties in the object it receives as an argument.

  Alan: {
    age: 27,
    online: false

Now you've seen all the basic operations for JavaScript objects. You can add, modify, and remove key-value pairs, check if keys exist, and iterate over all the keys in an object.

Now that you've learned the basics of arrays and objects, you're fully prepared to begin tackling more complex problems using JavaScript!

Take a look at the object we've provided in the code editor. The user object contains three keys. The data key contains five keys, one of which contains an array of friends.

// ___________________________________________ Object Oriented Programming
// ******************************************* 

// ___________________________________________ 1 Create a Basic JavaScript Object

/*
Think about things people see every day, like cars, shops, and birds. These are all objects: tangible things people can observe and interact with.

What are some qualities of these objects? A car has wheels. Shops sell items. Birds have wings.

These qualities, or properties, define what makes up an object. Note that similar objects share the same properties, but may have different values for those properties. For example, all cars have wheels, but not all cars have the same number of wheels.

Objects in JavaScript are used to model real-world objects, giving them properties and behavior just like their real-world counterparts. Here's an example using these concepts to create a duck object:

let duck = {
  name: "Aflac",
  numLegs: 2
};
This duck object has two property/value pairs: a name of Aflac and a numLegs of 2.

Create a dog object with name and numLegs properties, and set them to a string and a number, respectively.
*/
let dog = {
  name: 'Tobik',
  numLegs: 4
};
// ___________________________________________ 2 Use Dot Notation to Access the Properties of an Object

/*
The last challenge created an object with various properties. Now you'll see how to access the values of those properties. Here's an example:

let duck = {
  name: "Aflac",
  numLegs: 2
};
console.log(duck.name);
Dot notation is used on the object name, duck, followed by the name of the property, name, to access the value of Aflac.

Print both properties of the dog object to your console.
*/
let dog = {
  name: "Spot",
  numLegs: 4
};
// Only change code below this line
console.log(dog.name, dog.numLegs)
// ___________________________________________ 3 Create a Method on an Object

/*
Objects can have a special type of property, called a method.

Methods are properties that are functions. This adds different behavior to an object. Here is the duck example with a method:

let duck = {
  name: "Aflac",
  numLegs: 2,
  sayName: function() {return "The name of this duck is " + duck.name + ".";}
};
duck.sayName();
The example adds the sayName method, which is a function that returns a sentence giving the name of the duck. Notice that the method accessed the name property in the return statement using duck.name. The next challenge will cover another way to do this.

Using the dog object, give it a method called sayLegs. The method should return the sentence This dog has 4 legs.
*/
let dog = {
  name: "Spot",
  numLegs: 4,
  sayLegs() {
    return 'This dog has 4 legs.'
  }
};

dog.sayLegs();
// ___________________________________________ 4 Make Code More Reusable with the this Keyword

/*
The last challenge introduced a method to the duck object. It used duck.name dot notation to access the value for the name property within the return statement:

sayName: function() {return "The name of this duck is " + duck.name + ".";}
While this is a valid way to access the object's property, there is a pitfall here. If the variable name changes, any code referencing the original name would need to be updated as well. In a short object definition, it isn't a problem, but if an object has many references to its properties there is a greater chance for error.

A way to avoid these issues is with the this keyword:

let duck = {
  name: "Aflac",
  numLegs: 2,
  sayName: function() {return "The name of this duck is " + this.name + ".";}
};
this is a deep topic, and the above example is only one way to use it. In the current context, this refers to the object that the method is associated with: duck. If the object's name is changed to mallard, it is not necessary to find all the references to duck in the code. It makes the code reusable and easier to read.

Modify the dog.sayLegs method to remove any references to dog. Use the duck example for guidance.
*/
let dog = {
  name: "Spot",
  numLegs: 4,
  sayLegs: function() {return "This dog has " + this.numLegs + " legs.";}
};

dog.sayLegs();
// ___________________________________________ 5 Define a Constructor Function

/*
Constructors are functions that create new objects. They define properties and behaviors that will belong to the new object. Think of them as a blueprint for the creation of new objects.

Here is an example of a constructor:

function Bird() {
  this.name = "Albert";
  this.color = "blue";
  this.numLegs = 2;
}
This constructor defines a Bird object with properties name, color, and numLegs set to Albert, blue, and 2, respectively. Constructors follow a few conventions:

Constructors are defined with a capitalized name to distinguish them from other functions that are not constructors.
Constructors use the keyword this to set properties of the object they will create. Inside the constructor, this refers to the new object it will create.
Constructors define properties and behaviors instead of returning a value as other functions might.
Create a constructor, Dog, with properties name, color, and numLegs that are set to a string, a string, and a number, respectively.
*/
function Dog() {
  this.name = 'Tobik';
  this.color = 'brown';
  this.numLegs = 4;
}
// ___________________________________________ 6 Use a Constructor to Create Objects

/*
Here's the Bird constructor from the previous challenge:

function Bird() {
  this.name = "Albert";
  this.color  = "blue";
  this.numLegs = 2;
}

let blueBird = new Bird();
NOTE: this inside the constructor always refers to the object being created.

Notice that the new operator is used when calling a constructor. This tells JavaScript to create a new instance of Bird called blueBird. Without the new operator, this inside the constructor would not point to the newly created object, giving unexpected results. Now blueBird has all the properties defined inside the Bird constructor:

blueBird.name;
blueBird.color;
blueBird.numLegs;
Just like any other object, its properties can be accessed and modified:

blueBird.name = 'Elvira';
blueBird.name;
Use the Dog constructor from the last lesson to create a new instance of Dog, assigning it to a variable hound.
*/
function Dog() {
  this.name = "Rupert";
  this.color = "brown";
  this.numLegs = 4;
}
// Only change code below this line
const hound = new Dog()
// ___________________________________________ 7 Extend Constructors to Receive Arguments

/*
The Bird and Dog constructors from the last challenge worked well. However, notice that all Birds that are created with the Bird constructor are automatically named Albert, are blue in color, and have two legs. What if you want birds with different values for name and color? It's possible to change the properties of each bird manually but that would be a lot of work:

let swan = new Bird();
swan.name = "Carlos";
swan.color = "white";
Suppose you were writing a program to keep track of hundreds or even thousands of different birds in an aviary. It would take a lot of time to create all the birds, then change the properties to different values for every one. To more easily create different Bird objects, you can design your Bird constructor to accept parameters:

function Bird(name, color) {
  this.name = name;
  this.color = color;
  this.numLegs = 2;
}
Then pass in the values as arguments to define each unique bird into the Bird constructor: let cardinal = new Bird("Bruce", "red"); This gives a new instance of Bird with name and color properties set to Bruce and red, respectively. The numLegs property is still set to 2. The cardinal has these properties:

cardinal.name
cardinal.color
cardinal.numLegs
The constructor is more flexible. It's now possible to define the properties for each Bird at the time it is created, which is one way that JavaScript constructors are so useful. They group objects together based on shared characteristics and behavior and define a blueprint that automates their creation.

Create another Dog constructor. This time, set it up to take the parameters name and color, and have the property numLegs fixed at 4. Then create a new Dog saved in a variable terrier. Pass it two strings as arguments for the name and color properties.
*/
function Dog(name, color) {
  this.name = name;
  this.color = color;
  this.numLegs = 4;
}

let terrier = new Dog('Tobik', 'brown')
// ___________________________________________ 8 Verify an Object's Constructor with instanceof

/*
Anytime a constructor function creates a new object, that object is said to be an instance of its constructor. JavaScript gives a convenient way to verify this with the instanceof operator. instanceof allows you to compare an object to a constructor, returning true or false based on whether or not that object was created with the constructor. Here's an example:

let Bird = function(name, color) {
  this.name = name;
  this.color = color;
  this.numLegs = 2;
}

let crow = new Bird("Alexis", "black");

crow instanceof Bird;
This instanceof method would return true.

If an object is created without using a constructor, instanceof will verify that it is not an instance of that constructor:

let canary = {
  name: "Mildred",
  color: "Yellow",
  numLegs: 2
};

canary instanceof Bird;
This instanceof method would return false.

Create a new instance of the House constructor, calling it myHouse and passing a number of bedrooms. Then, use instanceof to verify that it is an instance of House.
*/
function House(numBedrooms) {
  this.numBedrooms = numBedrooms;
}

// Only change code below this line
let myHouse = new House(2)
myHouse instanceof House
// ___________________________________________ 9 Understand Own Properties

/*
In the following example, the Bird constructor defines two properties: name and numLegs:

function Bird(name) {
  this.name = name;
  this.numLegs = 2;
}

let duck = new Bird("Donald");
let canary = new Bird("Tweety");
name and numLegs are called own properties, because they are defined directly on the instance object. That means that duck and canary each has its own separate copy of these properties. In fact every instance of Bird will have its own copy of these properties. The following code adds all of the own properties of duck to the array ownProps:

let ownProps = [];

for (let property in duck) {
  if(duck.hasOwnProperty(property)) {
    ownProps.push(property);
  }
}

console.log(ownProps);
The console would display the value ["name", "numLegs"].

Add the own properties of canary to the array ownProps.
*/
function Bird(name) {
  this.name = name;
  this.numLegs = 2;
}

let canary = new Bird("Tweety");
let ownProps = [];
// Only change code below this line
for (let property in canary) {
  if(canary.hasOwnProperty(property)) {
    ownProps.push(property);
  }
}

// ___________________________________________ 10 Use Prototype Properties to Reduce Duplicate Code

/*
Since numLegs will probably have the same value for all instances of Bird, you essentially have a duplicated variable numLegs inside each Bird instance.

This may not be an issue when there are only two instances, but imagine if there are millions of instances. That would be a lot of duplicated variables.

A better way is to use the prototype of Bird. Properties in the prototype are shared among ALL instances of Bird. Here's how to add numLegs to the Bird prototype:

Bird.prototype.numLegs = 2;
Now all instances of Bird have the numLegs property.

console.log(duck.numLegs);
console.log(canary.numLegs);
Since all instances automatically have the properties on the prototype, think of a prototype as a "recipe" for creating objects. Note that the prototype for duck and canary is part of the Bird constructor as Bird.prototype.

Add a numLegs property to the prototype of Dog
*/
function Dog(name) {
  this.name = name;
}



// Only change code above this line
let beagle = new Dog("Snoopy");
Dog.prototype.numLegs = 4

// ___________________________________________ 11 Iterate Over All Properties

/*
You have now seen two kinds of properties: own properties and prototype properties. Own properties are defined directly on the object instance itself. And prototype properties are defined on the prototype.

function Bird(name) {
  this.name = name;  //own property
}

Bird.prototype.numLegs = 2; // prototype property

let duck = new Bird("Donald");
Here is how you add duck's own properties to the array ownProps and prototype properties to the array prototypeProps:

let ownProps = [];
let prototypeProps = [];

for (let property in duck) {
  if(duck.hasOwnProperty(property)) {
    ownProps.push(property);
  } else {
    prototypeProps.push(property);
  }
}

console.log(ownProps);
console.log(prototypeProps);
console.log(ownProps) would display ["name"] in the console, and console.log(prototypeProps) would display ["numLegs"].

Add all of the own properties of beagle to the array ownProps. Add all of the prototype properties of Dog to the array prototypeProps.
*/
function Dog(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

Dog.prototype.numLegs = 4;

let beagle = new Dog("Snoopy");

let ownProps = [];
let prototypeProps = [];

// Only change code below this line
for (let property in beagle) {
  if(beagle.hasOwnProperty(property)) {
    ownProps.push(property);
  } else {
    prototypeProps.push(property);
  }
}

// ___________________________________________ 12 Understand the Constructor Property

/*
There is a special constructor property located on the object instances duck and beagle that were created in the previous challenges:

let duck = new Bird();
let beagle = new Dog();

console.log(duck.constructor === Bird); 
console.log(beagle.constructor === Dog);
Both of these console.log calls would display true in the console.

Note that the constructor property is a reference to the constructor function that created the instance. The advantage of the constructor property is that it's possible to check for this property to find out what kind of object it is. Here's an example of how this could be used:

function joinBirdFraternity(candidate) {
  if (candidate.constructor === Bird) {
    return true;
  } else {
    return false;
  }
}
Note: Since the constructor property can be overwritten (which will be covered in the next two challenges) it’s generally better to use the instanceof method to check the type of an object.

Write a joinDogFraternity function that takes a candidate parameter and, using the constructor property, return true if the candidate is a Dog, otherwise return false.
*/
function Dog(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

// Only change code below this line
function joinDogFraternity(candidate) {
  if (candidate.constructor === Dog) {
    return true;
  } else {
    return false;
  }
}
// ___________________________________________ 13 Change the Prototype to a New Object

/*
Up until now you have been adding properties to the prototype individually:

Bird.prototype.numLegs = 2;
This becomes tedious after more than a few properties.

Bird.prototype.eat = function() {
  console.log("nom nom nom");
}

Bird.prototype.describe = function() {
  console.log("My name is " + this.name);
}
A more efficient way is to set the prototype to a new object that already contains the properties. This way, the properties are added all at once:

Bird.prototype = {
  numLegs: 2, 
  eat: function() {
    console.log("nom nom nom");
  },
  describe: function() {
    console.log("My name is " + this.name);
  }
};
Add the property numLegs and the two methods eat() and describe() to the prototype of Dog by setting the prototype to a new object.
*/
function Dog(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

Dog.prototype = {
  // Only change code below this line
  numLegs: 4,
  eat() {
    console.log('yammy')
  },
  describe() {
    console.log('My name is ' + this.name)
  }
};
// ___________________________________________ 14 Remember to Set the Constructor Property when Changing the Prototype

/*
There is one crucial side effect of manually setting the prototype to a new object. It erases the constructor property! This property can be used to check which constructor function created the instance, but since the property has been overwritten, it now gives false results:

duck.constructor === Bird;
duck.constructor === Object;
duck instanceof Bird;
In order, these expressions would evaluate to false, true, and true.

To fix this, whenever a prototype is manually set to a new object, remember to define the constructor property:

Bird.prototype = {
  constructor: Bird,
  numLegs: 2,
  eat: function() {
    console.log("nom nom nom");
  },
  describe: function() {
    console.log("My name is " + this.name); 
  }
};
Define the constructor property on the Dog prototype.
*/
function Dog(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

// Only change code below this line
Dog.prototype = {
  constructor: Dog,
  numLegs: 4,
  eat: function() {
    console.log("nom nom nom");
  },
  describe: function() {
    console.log("My name is " + this.name);
  }
};
// ___________________________________________ 15 Understand Where an Object’s Prototype Comes From

/*
Just like people inherit genes from their parents, an object inherits its prototype directly from the constructor function that created it. For example, here the Bird constructor creates the duck object:

function Bird(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

let duck = new Bird("Donald");
duck inherits its prototype from the Bird constructor function. You can show this relationship with the isPrototypeOf method:

Bird.prototype.isPrototypeOf(duck);
This would return true.

Use isPrototypeOf to check the prototype of beagle.
*/
function Dog(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

let beagle = new Dog("Snoopy");

// Only change code below this line
Dog.prototype.isPrototypeOf(beagle);
// ___________________________________________ 16 Understand the Prototype Chain

/*
All objects in JavaScript (with a few exceptions) have a prototype. Also, an object’s prototype itself is an object.

function Bird(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

typeof Bird.prototype;
Because a prototype is an object, a prototype can have its own prototype! In this case, the prototype of Bird.prototype is Object.prototype:

Object.prototype.isPrototypeOf(Bird.prototype);
How is this useful? You may recall the hasOwnProperty method from a previous challenge:

let duck = new Bird("Donald");
duck.hasOwnProperty("name");
The hasOwnProperty method is defined in Object.prototype, which can be accessed by Bird.prototype, which can then be accessed by duck. This is an example of the prototype chain. In this prototype chain, Bird is the supertype for duck, while duck is the subtype. Object is a supertype for both Bird and duck. Object is a supertype for all objects in JavaScript. Therefore, any object can use the hasOwnProperty method.

Modify the code to show the correct prototype chain.
*/
function Dog(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

let beagle = new Dog("Snoopy");

Dog.prototype.isPrototypeOf(beagle);  // yields true

// Fix the code below so that it evaluates to true
Object.prototype.isPrototypeOf(Dog.prototype);
// ___________________________________________ 17 Use Inheritance So You Don't Repeat Yourself

/*
There's a principle in programming called Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY). The reason repeated code is a problem is because any change requires fixing code in multiple places. This usually means more work for programmers and more room for errors.

Notice in the example below that the describe method is shared by Bird and Dog:

Bird.prototype = {
  constructor: Bird,
  describe: function() {
    console.log("My name is " + this.name);
  }
};

Dog.prototype = {
  constructor: Dog,
  describe: function() {
    console.log("My name is " + this.name);
  }
};
The describe method is repeated in two places. The code can be edited to follow the DRY principle by creating a supertype (or parent) called Animal:

function Animal() { };

Animal.prototype = {
  constructor: Animal, 
  describe: function() {
    console.log("My name is " + this.name);
  }
};
Since Animal includes the describe method, you can remove it from Bird and Dog:

Bird.prototype = {
  constructor: Bird
};

Dog.prototype = {
  constructor: Dog
};
The eat method is repeated in both Cat and Bear. Edit the code in the spirit of DRY by moving the eat method to the Animal supertype.
*/
function Cat(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

Cat.prototype = {
  constructor: Cat,
};

function Bear(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

Bear.prototype = {
  constructor: Bear,
};

function Animal() { }

Animal.prototype = {
  constructor: Animal,
  eat: function() {
    console.log("nom nom nom");
  }
};
// ___________________________________________ 18 Inherit Behaviors from a Supertype

/*
In the previous challenge, you created a supertype called Animal that defined behaviors shared by all animals:

function Animal() { }
Animal.prototype.eat = function() {
  console.log("nom nom nom");
};
This and the next challenge will cover how to reuse the methods of Animal inside Bird and Dog without defining them again. It uses a technique called inheritance. This challenge covers the first step: make an instance of the supertype (or parent). You already know one way to create an instance of Animal using the new operator:

let animal = new Animal();
There are some disadvantages when using this syntax for inheritance, which are too complex for the scope of this challenge. Instead, here's an alternative approach without those disadvantages:

let animal = Object.create(Animal.prototype);
Object.create(obj) creates a new object, and sets obj as the new object's prototype. Recall that the prototype is like the "recipe" for creating an object. By setting the prototype of animal to be the prototype of Animal, you are effectively giving the animal instance the same "recipe" as any other instance of Animal.

animal.eat();
animal instanceof Animal;
The instanceof method here would return true.

Use Object.create to make two instances of Animal named duck and beagle.
*/
function Animal() { }

Animal.prototype = {
  constructor: Animal,
  eat: function() {
    console.log("nom nom nom");
  }
};

let duck = Object.create(Animal.prototype); // Change this line
let beagle = Object.create(Animal.prototype); // Change this line
// ___________________________________________ 19 Set the Child's Prototype to an Instance of the Parent

/*
In the previous challenge you saw the first step for inheriting behavior from the supertype (or parent) Animal: making a new instance of Animal.

This challenge covers the next step: set the prototype of the subtype (or child)—in this case, Bird—to be an instance of Animal.

Bird.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);
Remember that the prototype is like the "recipe" for creating an object. In a way, the recipe for Bird now includes all the key "ingredients" from Animal.

let duck = new Bird("Donald");
duck.eat();
duck inherits all of Animal's properties, including the eat method.

Modify the code so that instances of Dog inherit from Animal.
*/
function Animal() { }

Animal.prototype = {
  constructor: Animal,
  eat: function() {
    console.log("nom nom nom");
  }
};

function Dog() { }

// Only change code below this line
Dog.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);

let beagle = new Dog();

// ___________________________________________ 20 Reset an Inherited Constructor Property

/*
When an object inherits its prototype from another object, it also inherits the supertype's constructor property.

Here's an example:

function Bird() { }
Bird.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);
let duck = new Bird();
duck.constructor
But duck and all instances of Bird should show that they were constructed by Bird and not Animal. To do so, you can manually set the constructor property of Bird to the Bird object:

Bird.prototype.constructor = Bird;
duck.constructor
Fix the code so duck.constructor and beagle.constructor return their respective constructors.
*/
function Animal() { }
function Bird() { }
function Dog() { }

Bird.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);
Dog.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);

// Only change code below this line
Bird.prototype.constructor = Bird;
Dog.prototype.constructor = Dog;

let duck = new Bird();
let beagle = new Dog();
// ___________________________________________ 21 Add Methods After Inheritance

/*
A constructor function that inherits its prototype object from a supertype constructor function can still have its own methods in addition to inherited methods.

For example, Bird is a constructor that inherits its prototype from Animal:

function Animal() { }
Animal.prototype.eat = function() {
  console.log("nom nom nom");
};
function Bird() { }
Bird.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);
Bird.prototype.constructor = Bird;
In addition to what is inherited from Animal, you want to add behavior that is unique to Bird objects. Here, Bird will get a fly() function. Functions are added to Bird's prototype the same way as any constructor function:

Bird.prototype.fly = function() {
  console.log("I'm flying!");
};
Now instances of Bird will have both eat() and fly() methods:

let duck = new Bird();
duck.eat();
duck.fly();
duck.eat() would display the string nom nom nom in the console, and duck.fly() would display the string I'm flying!.

Add all necessary code so the Dog object inherits from Animal and the Dog's prototype constructor is set to Dog. Then add a bark() method to the Dog object so that beagle can both eat() and bark(). The bark() method should print Woof! to the console.
*/
function Animal() { }
Animal.prototype.eat = function() { console.log("nom nom nom"); };

function Dog() { }

// Only change code below this line

Dog.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);
Dog.prototype.constructor = Dog;
Dog.prototype.bark = function() {
  console.log('Woof!')
}


// Only change code above this line

let beagle = new Dog();
// ___________________________________________ 22 Override Inherited Methods
 
/*
In previous lessons, you learned that an object can inherit its behavior (methods) from another object by referencing its prototype object:

ChildObject.prototype = Object.create(ParentObject.prototype);
Then the ChildObject received its own methods by chaining them onto its prototype:

ChildObject.prototype.methodName = function() {...};
It's possible to override an inherited method. It's done the same way - by adding a method to ChildObject.prototype using the same method name as the one to override. Here's an example of Bird overriding the eat() method inherited from Animal:

function Animal() { }
Animal.prototype.eat = function() {
  return "nom nom nom";
};
function Bird() { }

Bird.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);

Bird.prototype.eat = function() {
  return "peck peck peck";
};
If you have an instance let duck = new Bird(); and you call duck.eat(), this is how JavaScript looks for the method on the prototype chain of duck:

duck => Is eat() defined here? No.
Bird => Is eat() defined here? => Yes. Execute it and stop searching.
Animal => eat() is also defined, but JavaScript stopped searching before reaching this level.
Object => JavaScript stopped searching before reaching this level.
Override the fly() method for Penguin so that it returns the string Alas, this is a flightless bird.
*/
function Bird() { }

Bird.prototype.fly = function() { return "I am flying!"; };

function Penguin() { }
Penguin.prototype = Object.create(Bird.prototype);
Penguin.prototype.constructor = Penguin;

// Only change code below this line
Penguin.prototype.fly = function() {
  return 'Alas, this is a flightless bird.'
}


// Only change code above this line

let penguin = new Penguin();
console.log(penguin.fly());
// ___________________________________________ 23 Use a Mixin to Add Common Behavior Between Unrelated Objects

/*
As you have seen, behavior is shared through inheritance. However, there are cases when inheritance is not the best solution. Inheritance does not work well for unrelated objects like Bird and Airplane. They can both fly, but a Bird is not a type of Airplane and vice versa.

For unrelated objects, it's better to use mixins. A mixin allows other objects to use a collection of functions.

let flyMixin = function(obj) {
  obj.fly = function() {
    console.log("Flying, wooosh!");
  }
};
The flyMixin takes any object and gives it the fly method.

let bird = {
  name: "Donald",
  numLegs: 2
};

let plane = {
  model: "777",
  numPassengers: 524
};

flyMixin(bird);
flyMixin(plane);
Here bird and plane are passed into flyMixin, which then assigns the fly function to each object. Now bird and plane can both fly:

bird.fly();
plane.fly();
The console would display the string Flying, wooosh! twice, once for each .fly() call.

Note how the mixin allows for the same fly method to be reused by unrelated objects bird and plane.

Create a mixin named glideMixin that defines a method named glide. Then use the glideMixin to give both bird and boat the ability to glide.
*/
let bird = {
  name: "Donald",
  numLegs: 2
};

let boat = {
  name: "Warrior",
  type: "race-boat"
};

// Only change code below this line
let glideMixin = function(obj) {
  obj.glide = function() {
    console.log("i can glide!");
  }
};
glideMixin(bird);
glideMixin(boat);
// ___________________________________________ 24 Use Closure to Protect Properties Within an Object from Being Modified Externally

/*
In the previous challenge, bird had a public property name. It is considered public because it can be accessed and changed outside of bird's definition.

bird.name = "Duffy";
Therefore, any part of your code can easily change the name of bird to any value. Think about things like passwords and bank accounts being easily changeable by any part of your codebase. That could cause a lot of issues.

The simplest way to make this public property private is by creating a variable within the constructor function. This changes the scope of that variable to be within the constructor function versus available globally. This way, the variable can only be accessed and changed by methods also within the constructor function.

function Bird() {
  let hatchedEgg = 10;

  this.getHatchedEggCount = function() { 
    return hatchedEgg;
  };
}
let ducky = new Bird();
ducky.getHatchedEggCount();
Here getHatchedEggCount is a privileged method, because it has access to the private variable hatchedEgg. This is possible because hatchedEgg is declared in the same context as getHatchedEggCount. In JavaScript, a function always has access to the context in which it was created. This is called closure.

Change how weight is declared in the Bird function so it is a private variable. Then, create a method getWeight that returns the value of weight 15.
*/
function Bird() {
  let weight = 15;
  this.getWeight = function() { 
    return weight;
  };

}
// ___________________________________________ 25 Understand the Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE)

/*
A common pattern in JavaScript is to execute a function as soon as it is declared:

(function () {
  console.log("Chirp, chirp!");
})();
This is an anonymous function expression that executes right away, and outputs Chirp, chirp! immediately.

Note that the function has no name and is not stored in a variable. The two parentheses () at the end of the function expression cause it to be immediately executed or invoked. This pattern is known as an immediately invoked function expression or IIFE.

Rewrite the function makeNest and remove its call so instead it's an anonymous immediately invoked function expression (IIFE).
*/
(function () {
  console.log("A cozy nest is ready");
})()


// ___________________________________________ 26 Use an IIFE to Create a Module

/*
An immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) is often used to group related functionality into a single object or module. For example, an earlier challenge defined two mixins:

function glideMixin(obj) {
  obj.glide = function() {
    console.log("Gliding on the water");
  };
}
function flyMixin(obj) {
  obj.fly = function() {
    console.log("Flying, wooosh!");
  };
}
We can group these mixins into a module as follows:

let motionModule = (function () {
  return {
    glideMixin: function(obj) {
      obj.glide = function() {
        console.log("Gliding on the water");
      };
    },
    flyMixin: function(obj) {
      obj.fly = function() {
        console.log("Flying, wooosh!");
      };
    }
  }
})();
Note that you have an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) that returns an object motionModule. This returned object contains all of the mixin behaviors as properties of the object. The advantage of the module pattern is that all of the motion behaviors can be packaged into a single object that can then be used by other parts of your code. Here is an example using it:

motionModule.glideMixin(duck);
duck.glide();
Create a module named funModule to wrap the two mixins isCuteMixin and singMixin. funModule should return an object.
*/
let isCuteMixin = function(obj) {
  obj.isCute = function() {
    return true;
  };
};
let singMixin = function(obj) {
  obj.sing = function() {
    console.log("Singing to an awesome tune");
  };
};

let funModule  = (function () {
  return {
    isCuteMixin: function(obj) {
      obj.isCute = function() {
        return true;
      };
    },
    singMixin: function(obj) {
      obj.sing = function() {
        console.log("Singing to an awesome tune");
      };
    }
  }
})();

// ___________________________________________ 1 Learn About Functional Programming

/*
Functional programming is a style of programming where solutions are simple, isolated functions, without any side effects outside of the function scope: INPUT -> PROCESS -> OUTPUT

Functional programming is about:

Isolated functions - there is no dependence on the state of the program, which includes global variables that are subject to change

Pure functions - the same input always gives the same output

Functions with limited side effects - any changes, or mutations, to the state of the program outside the function are carefully controlled

The members of freeCodeCamp happen to love tea.

In the code editor, the prepareTea and getTea functions are already defined for you. Call the getTea function to get 40 cups of tea for the team, and store them in the tea4TeamFCC variable.
*/
// Function that returns a string representing a cup of green tea
const prepareTea = () => 'greenTea';

/*
Given a function (representing the tea type) and number of cups needed, the
following function returns an array of strings (each representing a cup of
a specific type of tea).
*/
const getTea = (numOfCups) => {
  const teaCups = [];

  for(let cups = 1; cups <= numOfCups; cups += 1) {
    const teaCup = prepareTea();
    teaCups.push(teaCup);
  }
  return teaCups;
};

// Only change code below this line
const tea4TeamFCC = getTea(40);
// Only change code above this line

// ___________________________________________ 2 Understand Functional Programming Terminology

/*
The FCC Team had a mood swing and now wants two types of tea: green tea and black tea. General Fact: Client mood swings are pretty common.

With that information, we'll need to revisit the getTea function from last challenge to handle various tea requests. We can modify getTea to accept a function as a parameter to be able to change the type of tea it prepares. This makes getTea more flexible, and gives the programmer more control when client requests change.

But first, let's cover some functional terminology:

Callbacks are the functions that are slipped or passed into another function to decide the invocation of that function. You may have seen them passed to other methods, for example in filter, the callback function tells JavaScript the criteria for how to filter an array.

Functions that can be assigned to a variable, passed into another function, or returned from another function just like any other normal value, are called first class functions. In JavaScript, all functions are first class functions.

The functions that take a function as an argument, or return a function as a return value, are called higher order functions.

When functions are passed in to or returned from another function, then those functions which were passed in or returned can be called a lambda.

Prepare 27 cups of green tea and 13 cups of black tea and store them in tea4GreenTeamFCC and tea4BlackTeamFCC variables, respectively. Note that the getTea function has been modified so it now takes a function as the first argument.

Note: The data (the number of cups of tea) is supplied as the last argument. We'll discuss this more in later lessons.
*/
// Function that returns a string representing a cup of green tea
const prepareGreenTea = () => 'greenTea';

// Function that returns a string representing a cup of black tea
const prepareBlackTea = () => 'blackTea';

/*
Given a function (representing the tea type) and number of cups needed, the
following function returns an array of strings (each representing a cup of
a specific type of tea).
*/
const getTea = (prepareTea, numOfCups) => {
  const teaCups = [];

  for(let cups = 1; cups <= numOfCups; cups += 1) {
    const teaCup = prepareTea();
    teaCups.push(teaCup);
  }
  return teaCups;
};

// Only change code below this line
const tea4GreenTeamFCC = getTea(prepareGreenTea, 27);
const tea4BlackTeamFCC = getTea(prepareBlackTea, 13);;
// Only change code above this line

  tea4GreenTeamFCC,
  tea4BlackTeamFCC
);
// ___________________________________________ 3 Understand the Hazards of Using Imperative Code

/*
Functional programming is a good habit. It keeps your code easy to manage, and saves you from sneaky bugs. But before we get there, let's look at an imperative approach to programming to highlight where you may have issues.

In English (and many other languages), the imperative tense is used to give commands. Similarly, an imperative style in programming is one that gives the computer a set of statements to perform a task.

Often the statements change the state of the program, like updating global variables. A classic example is writing a for loop that gives exact directions to iterate over the indices of an array.

In contrast, functional programming is a form of declarative programming. You tell the computer what you want done by calling a method or function.

JavaScript offers many predefined methods that handle common tasks so you don't need to write out how the computer should perform them. For example, instead of using the for loop mentioned above, you could call the map method which handles the details of iterating over an array. This helps to avoid semantic errors, like the "Off By One Errors" that were covered in the Debugging section.

Consider the scenario: you are browsing the web in your browser, and want to track the tabs you have opened. Let's try to model this using some simple object-oriented code.

A Window object is made up of tabs, and you usually have more than one Window open. The titles of each open site in each Window object is held in an array. After working in the browser (opening new tabs, merging windows, and closing tabs), you want to print the tabs that are still open. Closed tabs are removed from the array and new tabs (for simplicity) get added to the end of it.

The code editor shows an implementation of this functionality with functions for tabOpen(), tabClose(), and join(). The array tabs is part of the Window object that stores the name of the open pages.

Examine the code in the editor. It's using a method that has side effects in the program, causing incorrect behaviour. The final list of open tabs, stored in finalTabs.tabs, should be ['FB', 'Gitter', 'Reddit', 'Twitter', 'Medium', 'new tab', 'Netflix', 'YouTube', 'Vine', 'GMail', 'Work mail', 'Docs', 'freeCodeCamp', 'new tab'] but the list produced by the code is slightly different.

Change Window.prototype.tabClose so that it removes the correct tab.
*/
// tabs is an array of titles of each site open within the window
const Window = function(tabs) {
  this.tabs = tabs; // We keep a record of the array inside the object
};

// When you join two windows into one window
Window.prototype.join = function(otherWindow) {
  this.tabs = this.tabs.concat(otherWindow.tabs);
  return this;
};

// When you open a new tab at the end
Window.prototype.tabOpen = function(tab) {
  this.tabs.push('new tab'); // Let's open a new tab for now
  return this;
};

// When you close a tab
Window.prototype.tabClose = function(index) {

  // Only change code below this line

  this.tabs = this.tabs.filter((_, i) => i !== index); // Join them together

  // Only change code above this line

  return this;
 };

// Let's create three browser windows
const workWindow = new Window(['GMail', 'Inbox', 'Work mail', 'Docs', 'freeCodeCamp']); // Your mailbox, drive, and other work sites
const socialWindow = new Window(['FB', 'Gitter', 'Reddit', 'Twitter', 'Medium']); // Social sites
const videoWindow = new Window(['Netflix', 'YouTube', 'Vimeo', 'Vine']); // Entertainment sites

// Now perform the tab opening, closing, and other operations
const finalTabs = socialWindow
  .tabOpen() // Open a new tab for cat memes
  .join(videoWindow.tabClose(2)) // Close third tab in video window, and join
  .join(workWindow.tabClose(1).tabOpen());
console.log(finalTabs.tabs);
// ___________________________________________ 4 Avoid Mutations and Side Effects Using Functional Programming

/*
If you haven't already figured it out, the issue in the previous challenge was with the splice call in the tabClose() function. Unfortunately, splice changes the original array it is called on, so the second call to it used a modified array, and gave unexpected results.

This is a small example of a much larger pattern - you call a function on a variable, array, or an object, and the function changes the variable or something in the object.

One of the core principles of functional programming is to not change things. Changes lead to bugs. It's easier to prevent bugs knowing that your functions don't change anything, including the function arguments or any global variable.

The previous example didn't have any complicated operations but the splice method changed the original array, and resulted in a bug.

Recall that in functional programming, changing or altering things is called mutation, and the outcome is called a side effect. A function, ideally, should be a pure function, meaning that it does not cause any side effects.

Let's try to master this discipline and not alter any variable or object in our code.

Fill in the code for the function incrementer so it returns the value of the global variable fixedValue increased by one.
*/
// The global variable
let fixedValue = 4;

function incrementer() {
  // Only change code below this line
  let fixedValueCopy = fixedValue
  return fixedValueCopy+1

  // Only change code above this line
}
// ___________________________________________ 5 Pass Arguments to Avoid External Dependence in a Function

/*
The last challenge was a step closer to functional programming principles, but there is still something missing.

We didn't alter the global variable value, but the function incrementer would not work without the global variable fixedValue being there.

Another principle of functional programming is to always declare your dependencies explicitly. This means if a function depends on a variable or object being present, then pass that variable or object directly into the function as an argument.

There are several good consequences from this principle. The function is easier to test, you know exactly what input it takes, and it won't depend on anything else in your program.

This can give you more confidence when you alter, remove, or add new code. You would know what you can or cannot change and you can see where the potential traps are.

Finally, the function would always produce the same output for the same set of inputs, no matter what part of the code executes it.

Let's update the incrementer function to clearly declare its dependencies.

Write the incrementer function so it takes an argument, and then returns a result after increasing the value by one.
*/
// The global variable
let fixedValue = 4;

// Only change code below this line
function incrementer(value) {
  return value+1

  // Only change code above this line
}
// ___________________________________________ 6 Refactor Global Variables Out of Functions

/*
So far, we have seen two distinct principles for functional programming:

Don't alter a variable or object - create new variables and objects and return them if need be from a function. Hint: using something like const newArr = arrVar, where arrVar is an array will simply create a reference to the existing variable and not a copy. So changing a value in newArr would change the value in arrVar.

Declare function parameters - any computation inside a function depends only on the arguments passed to the function, and not on any global object or variable.

Adding one to a number is not very exciting, but we can apply these principles when working with arrays or more complex objects.

Rewrite the code so the global array bookList is not changed inside either function. The add function should add the given bookName to the end of the array passed to it and return a new array (list). The remove function should remove the given bookName from the array passed to it.

Note: Both functions should return an array, and any new parameters should be added before the bookName parameter.
*/
// The global variable
const bookList = ["The Hound of the Baskervilles", "On The Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies", "Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica", "Disquisitiones Arithmeticae"];

// Change code below this line
function add(bookList, bookName) {
  let bookListCopy = [...bookList]
  bookListCopy.push(bookName);
  return bookListCopy;
  
  // Change code above this line
}

// Change code below this line
function remove(bookList, bookName) {
  let bookListCopy = [...bookList]
  const book_index = bookListCopy.indexOf(bookName);
  if (book_index >= 0) {

    bookListCopy.splice(book_index, 1);
    return bookListCopy;

    // Change code above this line
    }
}
// ___________________________________________ 7 Use the map Method to Extract Data from an Array

/*
So far we have learned to use pure functions to avoid side effects in a program. Also, we have seen the value in having a function only depend on its input arguments.

This is only the beginning. As its name suggests, functional programming is centered around a theory of functions.

It would make sense to be able to pass them as arguments to other functions, and return a function from another function. Functions are considered first class objects in JavaScript, which means they can be used like any other object. They can be saved in variables, stored in an object, or passed as function arguments.

Let's start with some simple array functions, which are methods on the array object prototype. In this exercise we are looking at Array.prototype.map(), or more simply map.

The map method iterates over each item in an array and returns a new array containing the results of calling the callback function on each element. It does this without mutating the original array.

When the callback is used, it is passed three arguments. The first argument is the current element being processed. The second is the index of that element and the third is the array upon which the map method was called.

See below for an example using the map method on the users array to return a new array containing only the names of the users as elements. For simplicity, the example only uses the first argument of the callback.

const users = [
  { name: 'John', age: 34 },
  { name: 'Amy', age: 20 },
  { name: 'camperCat', age: 10 }
];

const names = users.map(user => user.name);
console.log(names);
The console would display the value  [ 'John', 'Amy', 'camperCat' ].

The watchList array holds objects with information on several movies. Use map on watchList to assign a new array of objects to the ratings variable. Each movie in the new array should have only a title key with the name of the film, and a rating key with the IMDB rating. The code in the editor currently uses a for loop to do this, so you should replace the loop functionality with your map expression.

// ___________________________________________ 8 Implement map on a Prototype

/*
As you have seen from applying Array.prototype.map(), or simply map() earlier, the map method returns an array of the same length as the one it was called on. It also doesn't alter the original array, as long as its callback function doesn't.

In other words, map is a pure function, and its output depends solely on its inputs. Plus, it takes another function as its argument.

You might learn a lot about the map method if you implement your own version of it. It is recommended you use a for loop or Array.prototype.forEach().

Write your own Array.prototype.myMap(), which should behave exactly like Array.prototype.map(). You should not use the built-in map method. The Array instance can be accessed in the myMap method using this.
*/
Array.prototype.myMap = function(callback) {
  const newArray = [];
  // Only change code below this line
  for (let i = 0; i < this.length; i++) {
      newArray.push(callback(this[i], i, this))
  }
  // Only change code above this line
  return newArray;
};

console.log([23, 65, 98, 5, 13].myMap(item => item * 2))
// ___________________________________________ 9 Use the filter Method to Extract Data from an Array

/*
Another useful array function is Array.prototype.filter(), or simply filter().

filter calls a function on each element of an array and returns a new array containing only the elements for which that function returns a truthy value - that is, a value which returns true if passed to the Boolean() constructor. In other words, it filters the array, based on the function passed to it. Like map, it does this without needing to modify the original array.

The callback function accepts three arguments. The first argument is the current element being processed. The second is the index of that element and the third is the array upon which the filter method was called.

See below for an example using the filter method on the users array to return a new array containing only the users under the age of 30. For simplicity, the example only uses the first argument of the callback.

const users = [
  { name: 'John', age: 34 },
  { name: 'Amy', age: 20 },
  { name: 'camperCat', age: 10 }
];

const usersUnder30 = users.filter(user => user.age < 30);
console.log(usersUnder30); 
The console would display the value [ { name: 'Amy', age: 20 }, { name: 'camperCat', age: 10 } ].

The variable watchList holds an array of objects with information on several movies. Use a combination of filter and map on watchList to assign a new array of objects with only title and rating keys. The new array should only include objects where imdbRating is greater than or equal to 8.0. Note that the rating values are saved as strings in the object and you may need to convert them into numbers to perform mathematical operations on them.

// ___________________________________________ 10 Implement the filter Method on a Prototype

/*
You might learn a lot about the filter method if you implement your own version of it. It is recommended you use a for loop or Array.prototype.forEach().

Write your own Array.prototype.myFilter(), which should behave exactly like Array.prototype.filter(). You should not use the built-in filter method. The Array instance can be accessed in the myFilter method using this.
*/
Array.prototype.myFilter = function(callback) {
  const newArray = [];
  // Only change code below this line
  for (let i = 0; i < this.length; i++) {
    if (callback(this[i], i, this)) {
        newArray.push(this[i])
    }
  }
  // Only change code above this line
  return newArray;
};
console.log([23, 65, 98, 5, 13].myFilter(item => item > 20))
// ___________________________________________ Return Part of an Array Using the slice Method

/*
The slice method returns a copy of certain elements of an array. It can take two arguments, the first gives the index of where to begin the slice, the second is the index for where to end the slice (and it's non-inclusive). If the arguments are not provided, the default is to start at the beginning of the array through the end, which is an easy way to make a copy of the entire array. The slice method does not mutate the original array, but returns a new one.

Here's an example:

const arr = ["Cat", "Dog", "Tiger", "Zebra"];
const newArray = arr.slice(1, 3);
newArray would have the value ["Dog", "Tiger"].

Use the slice method in the sliceArray function to return part of the anim array given the provided beginSlice and endSlice indices. The function should return an array.
*/
function sliceArray(anim, beginSlice, endSlice) {
  // Only change code below this line
  return anim.slice(beginSlice, endSlice) 
  // Only change code above this line
}

const inputAnim = ["Cat", "Dog", "Tiger", "Zebra", "Ant"];
sliceArray(inputAnim, 1, 3);
// ___________________________________________ Remove Elements from an Array Using slice Instead of splice

/*
A common pattern while working with arrays is when you want to remove items and keep the rest of the array. JavaScript offers the splice method for this, which takes arguments for the index of where to start removing items, then the number of items to remove. If the second argument is not provided, the default is to remove items through the end. However, the splice method mutates the original array it is called on. Here's an example:

const cities = ["Chicago", "Delhi", "Islamabad", "London", "Berlin"];
cities.splice(3, 1);
Here splice returns the string London and deletes it from the cities array. cities will have the value ["Chicago", "Delhi", "Islamabad", "Berlin"].

As we saw in the last challenge, the slice method does not mutate the original array, but returns a new one which can be saved into a variable. Recall that the slice method takes two arguments for the indices to begin and end the slice (the end is non-inclusive), and returns those items in a new array. Using the slice method instead of splice helps to avoid any array-mutating side effects.

Rewrite the function nonMutatingSplice by using slice instead of splice. It should limit the provided cities array to a length of 3, and return a new array with only the first three items.

Do not mutate the original array provided to the function.
*/
function nonMutatingSplice(cities) {
  return cities.slice(0,3);
}
// ___________________________________________ Combine Two Arrays Using the concat Method

/*
Concatenation means to join items end to end. JavaScript offers the concat method for both strings and arrays that work in the same way. For arrays, the method is called on one, then another array is provided as the argument to concat, which is added to the end of the first array. It returns a new array and does not mutate either of the original arrays. Here's an example:

[1, 2, 3].concat([4, 5, 6]);
The returned array would be [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].

Use the concat method in the nonMutatingConcat function to concatenate attach to the end of original. The function should return the concatenated array.
*/
function nonMutatingConcat(original, attach) {
  // Only change code below this line

  return original.concat(attach)
  // Only change code above this line
}

const first = [1, 2, 3];
const second = [4, 5];
nonMutatingConcat(first, second);
// ___________________________________________ Add Elements to the End of an Array Using concat Instead of push

/*
Functional programming is all about creating and using non-mutating functions.

The last challenge introduced the concat method as a way to merge arrays into a new array without mutating the original arrays. Compare concat to the push method. push adds items to the end of the same array it is called on, which mutates that array. Here's an example:

const arr = [1, 2, 3];
arr.push(4, 5, 6);
arr would have a modified value of [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], which is not the functional programming way.

concat offers a way to merge new items to the end of an array without any mutating side effects.

Change the nonMutatingPush function so it uses concat to merge newItem to the end of original without mutating original or newItem arrays. The function should return an array.
*/
function nonMutatingPush(original, newItem) {
  // Only change code below this line
  return original.concat(newItem);

  // Only change code above this line
}

const first = [1, 2, 3];
const second = [4, 5];
nonMutatingPush(first, second);
// ___________________________________________ Use the reduce Method to Analyze Data

/*
Array.prototype.reduce(), or simply reduce(), is the most general of all array operations in JavaScript. You can solve almost any array processing problem using the reduce method.

The reduce method allows for more general forms of array processing, and it's possible to show that both filter and map can be derived as special applications of reduce. The reduce method iterates over each item in an array and returns a single value (i.e. string, number, object, array). This is achieved via a callback function that is called on each iteration.

The callback function accepts four arguments. The first argument is known as the accumulator, which gets assigned the return value of the callback function from the previous iteration, the second is the current element being processed, the third is the index of that element and the fourth is the array upon which reduce is called.

In addition to the callback function, reduce has an additional parameter which takes an initial value for the accumulator. If this second parameter is not used, then the first iteration is skipped and the second iteration gets passed the first element of the array as the accumulator.

See below for an example using reduce on the users array to return the sum of all the users' ages. For simplicity, the example only uses the first and second arguments.

const users = [
  { name: 'John', age: 34 },
  { name: 'Amy', age: 20 },
  { name: 'camperCat', age: 10 }
];

const sumOfAges = users.reduce((sum, user) => sum + user.age, 0);
console.log(sumOfAges);
The console would display the value 64.

In another example, see how an object can be returned containing the names of the users as properties with their ages as values.

const users = [
  { name: 'John', age: 34 },
  { name: 'Amy', age: 20 },
  { name: 'camperCat', age: 10 }
];

const usersObj = users.reduce((obj, user) => {
  obj[user.name] = user.age;
  return obj;
}, {});
console.log(usersObj);
The console would display the value { John: 34, Amy: 20, camperCat: 10 }.

The variable watchList holds an array of objects with information on several movies. Use reduce to find the average IMDB rating of the movies directed by Christopher Nolan. Recall from prior challenges how to filter data and map over it to pull what you need. You may need to create other variables, and return the average rating from getRating function. Note that the rating values are saved as strings in the object and need to be converted into numbers before they are used in any mathematical operations.

Now that you have worked through a few challenges using higher-order functions like map(), filter(), and reduce(), you now get to apply them to solve a more complex challenge.

Complete the code for the squareList function using any combination of map(), filter(), and reduce(). The function should return a new array containing the squares of only the positive integers (decimal numbers are not integers) when an array of real numbers is passed to it. An example of an array of real numbers is [-3, 4.8, 5, 3, -3.2].

Note: Your function should not use any kind of for or while loops or the forEach() function.
*/
const squareList = arr => {
  // Only change code below this line
  const filtered = arr.filter(n => n > 0 && Number.isInteger(n));
  return filtered.map(n => n*n)
  // Only change code above this line
};

const squaredIntegers = squareList([4, 5.6, -9.8, 3.14, 42, 6, 8.34, -2]);
console.log(squaredIntegers);
// ___________________________________________ Sort an Array Alphabetically using the sort Method
 
/*
The sort method sorts the elements of an array according to the callback function.

For example:

function ascendingOrder(arr) {
  return arr.sort(function(a, b) {
    return a - b;
  });
}

ascendingOrder([1, 5, 2, 3, 4]);
This would return the value [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].

function reverseAlpha(arr) {
  return arr.sort(function(a, b) {
    return a === b ? 0 : a < b ? 1 : -1;
  });
}

reverseAlpha(['l', 'h', 'z', 'b', 's']);
This would return the value ['z', 's', 'l', 'h', 'b'].

JavaScript's default sorting method is by string Unicode point value, which may return unexpected results. Therefore, it is encouraged to provide a callback function to specify how to sort the array items. When such a callback function, normally called compareFunction, is supplied, the array elements are sorted according to the return value of the compareFunction: If compareFunction(a,b) returns a value less than 0 for two elements a and b, then a will come before b. If compareFunction(a,b) returns a value greater than 0 for two elements a and b, then b will come before a. If compareFunction(a,b) returns a value equal to 0 for two elements a and b, then a and b will remain unchanged.

Use the sort method in the alphabeticalOrder function to sort the elements of arr in alphabetical order. The function should return the sorted array.
*/
function alphabeticalOrder(arr) {
  // Only change code below this line

  return arr.sort((a,b) => a === b ? 0 : b < a ? 1 : -1)
  // Only change code above this line
}

alphabeticalOrder(["a", "d", "c", "a", "z", "g"]);
// ___________________________________________ Return a Sorted Array Without Changing the Original Array

/*
A side effect of the sort method is that it changes the order of the elements in the original array. In other words, it mutates the array in place. One way to avoid this is to first concatenate an empty array to the one being sorted (remember that slice and concat return a new array), then run the sort method.

Use the sort method in the nonMutatingSort function to sort the elements of an array in ascending order. The function should return a new array, and not mutate the globalArray variable.
*/
const globalArray = [5, 6, 3, 2, 9];

function nonMutatingSort(arr) {
  // Only change code below this line

  return arr.concat([]).sort((a,b) => a - b)
  // Only change code above this line
}

nonMutatingSort(globalArray);
// ___________________________________________ Split a String into an Array Using the split Method

/*
The split method splits a string into an array of strings. It takes an argument for the delimiter, which can be a character to use to break up the string or a regular expression. For example, if the delimiter is a space, you get an array of words, and if the delimiter is an empty string, you get an array of each character in the string.

Here are two examples that split one string by spaces, then another by digits using a regular expression:

const str = "Hello World";
const bySpace = str.split(" ");

const otherString = "How9are7you2today";
const byDigits = otherString.split(/\d/);
bySpace would have the value ["Hello", "World"] and byDigits would have the value ["How", "are", "you", "today"].

Since strings are immutable, the split method makes it easier to work with them.

Use the split method inside the splitify function to split str into an array of words. The function should return the array. Note that the words are not always separated by spaces, and the array should not contain punctuation.
*/
function splitify(str) {
  // Only change code below this line

  return str.split(/\W/)
  // Only change code above this line
}

splitify("Hello World,I-am code");
// ___________________________________________ Combine an Array into a String Using the join Method

/*
The join method is used to join the elements of an array together to create a string. It takes an argument for the delimiter that is used to separate the array elements in the string.

Here's an example:

const arr = ["Hello", "World"];
const str = arr.join(" ");
str would have a value of the string Hello World.

Use the join method (among others) inside the sentensify function to make a sentence from the words in the string str. The function should return a string. For example, I-like-Star-Wars would be converted to I like Star Wars. For this challenge, do not use the replace method.
*/

function sentensify(str) {
  // Only change code below this line
  return str.split(/\W/).join(' ')
  // Only change code above this line

sentensify("May-the-force-be-with-you");
// ___________________________________________ Apply Functional Programming to Convert Strings to URL Slugs

/*
The last several challenges covered a number of useful array and string methods that follow functional programming principles. We've also learned about reduce, which is a powerful method used to reduce problems to simpler forms. From computing averages to sorting, any array operation can be achieved by applying it. Recall that map and filter are special cases of reduce.

Let's combine what we've learned to solve a practical problem.

Many content management sites (CMS) have the titles of a post added to part of the URL for simple bookmarking purposes. For example, if you write a Medium post titled Stop Using Reduce, it's likely the URL would have some form of the title string in it (.../stop-using-reduce). You may have already noticed this on the freeCodeCamp site.

Fill in the urlSlug function so it converts a string title and returns the hyphenated version for the URL. You can use any of the methods covered in this section, and don't use replace. Here are the requirements:

The input is a string with spaces and title-cased words

The output is a string with the spaces between words replaced by a hyphen (-)

The output should be all lower-cased letters

The output should not have any spaces
*/
// Only change code below this line
function urlSlug(title) {
  const lowed = title.toLowerCase().split(' ').filter(l => l !== '')
  console.log(lowed)
  const hyphened = lowed.map((w,i) => i === lowed.length-1 ? w : w + '-')
  console.log(hyphened)
  return hyphened.join('')
}
// Only change code above this line
console.log(urlSlug(" Winter Is  Coming"))
urlSlug(" Winter Is  Coming");

const numbers = [1, 5, 8, 0, 10, 11];

numbers.every(function(currentValue) {
  return currentValue < 10;

// ___________________________________________ Introduction to Currying and Partial Application

/*
The arity of a function is the number of arguments it requires. Currying a function means to convert a function of N arity into N functions of arity 1.

In other words, it restructures a function so it takes one argument, then returns another function that takes the next argument, and so on.

Here's an example:

function unCurried(x, y) {
  return x + y;
}

function curried(x) {
  return function(y) {
    return x + y;
  }
}

const curried = x => y => x + y

curried(1)(2)
curried(1)(2) would return 3.

This is useful in your program if you can't supply all the arguments to a function at one time. You can save each function call into a variable, which will hold the returned function reference that takes the next argument when it's available. Here's an example using the curried function in the example above:

const funcForY = curried(1);
console.log(funcForY(2)); // 3
Similarly, partial application can be described as applying a few arguments to a function at a time and returning another function that is applied to more arguments. Here's an example:

function impartial(x, y, z) {
  return x + y + z;
}

const partialFn = impartial.bind(this, 1, 2);
partialFn(10); // 13
Fill in the body of the add function so it uses currying to add parameters x, y, and z.
*/
function add(x) {
  // Only change code below this line
  return function(y) {
    return function(z) {
      return x + y + z
    }
  }

  // Only change code above this line
}

add(10)(20)(30);

// ___________________________________________ Caesars Cipher


/*
One of the simplest and most widely known ciphers is a Caesar cipher, also known as a shift cipher. In a shift cipher the meanings of the letters are shifted by some set amount.

A common modern use is the ROT13 cipher, where the values of the letters are shifted by 13 places. Thus A ↔ N, B ↔ O and so on.

Write a function which takes a ROT13 encoded string as input and returns a decoded string.

All letters will be uppercase. Do not transform any non-alphabetic character (i.e. spaces, punctuation), but do pass them on.
